ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I would like to first express my gratitude and appreciation to Dr. Salvatore Salamone. His enthusiasm, encouragement, and support during my doctoral studies have been invaluable. All our discussions about the subjects of my dissertation were extremely helpful, but above all, his understanding, trust, and flexibility to my personal opinions could allow me to grow professionally and be productive.
Special thanks to the committee members: Professor Andrew Whittaker for his comprehensive support and the opportunity he gave me as the project PI to collaborate on a NSF funded research study titled “Performance-Based Design of Squat Reinforced Concrete Shear Walls (CMMI-0829978)”, and Professor Amjad Aref for his kind and valuable advices since the beginning of my PhD studies. I also would like to thank Professor Aref and Professor Andre Filiatrault as the PIs of the NEES lifeline project titled “Earthquake Response and Rehabilitation of Critical Lifelines (Grant No.: CMS-421142). 
I would like to thank the staff of the Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation Laboratory (SEESL) at the University at Buffalo. The experimental portion of this research could not have been completed without their cooperation and support. Special thanks are due to my fellow graduate students Ehsan Dehghan Niri, Bismarck Luna, Joshua Rocks, and Zilan Zhong, as well as my undergraduate research assistants, Tresor Mavinga, and Jan Dokonal. 
I also want to thank my parents, my parents-in-law, my brother, and my brother-in-law for their encouragement, selfless love and boundless support during my studies. 
I am eternally grateful to my wife, Zahra. Your infinite love in my heart empowered me to be successful. I would not have made it if it was not for you. Your full support during the past four years is invaluable. We studied together, passed the qualifying exam together, and achieved academic success together. Thank you.

INTRODUCTION

General
Civil structures such as buildings, bridges, nuclear power plants or pipelines are complex systems that are vital to the well-being of our society. Safety and durability of civil structures play a very important role in ensuring the economic and industrial prosperity of society. Unfortunately, many of these structures are facing an increasing number of challenges that can jeopardize their safety and serviceability. Some of these challenges, such as aging and maintenance, are life-cycle related and expected. Other challenges such as man-made hazards or natural events (i.e., earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami) are not expected and can weaken and destabilize a structure. Therefore, an important task is to reliably assess the condition of a given structure and to ensure that safety standards are met throughout its operational life. It is also beneficial for the owners and facility operators of a structure to know the extent of its deterioration and to estimate its remaining life.
Currently, assessing the performance and safety of civil structures relies on visual inspection, and unfortunately, even with the recent advances in automated ground-based nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods, there is a potential that indications of structural degradation could be missed. Notable examples of such unanticipated failures that have exposed shortcomings in condition assessment methodologies can be found worldwide. In 1986 the bridge over the Mandovi River in Goa, India collapsed due to corrosion of the post-tensioning cables less than 20 years since its construction (Clark, 2013). Figure ?1 1 shows a post-tensioned beam with heavily corroded steel strands. In the year 1999, a rupture in gas line caused a massive gasoline leakage into a creek in Bellingham, Washington; the gasoline ignited and burned approximately 1.5 miles along the creek (see Figure ?1 2) (National Transportation Safety Board, 2002). The Canterbury television building in Christchurch, New Zealand, collapsed during the magnitude 6.1 earthquake on February 2011; the building was inspected by engineers after a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in September 2010 and after the 4.9 magnitude aftershock on December 2010. On both occasions, the building was declared safe, having suffered only superficial damage; the 115 who died in that building alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of the 181 victims (DBH, 2011).

Integrated structural health monitoring (SHM) systems have emerged as a potential high impact technology for reducing life-cycle costs and improving the safety of civil infrastructures. As a result, attention to this topic has continually grown in the past few decades, resulting in hundreds of papers, two international conferences, a journal (Journal of Structural Health Monitoring) [ref], several books and an encyclopedia [ref]. Although such systems have seen significant developments in the last two decades, very few if any have been transitioned to practice.

Objectives of the dissertation
The general objective of this dissertation is to design integrated SHM methods for the nondestructive evaluation of civil structures. Overall, it is proposed to use NDE techniques, such as acoustic emission (AE), guided ultrasonic waves (GUW), and automated visual inspection, coupled to advanced statistical-based signal processing algorithms to locate structural anomalies. To validate the proposed methods, experimental studies were carried out in the Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation Laboratory (SEESL) and Smart Structures Research Laboratory at the University at Buffalo.
The main objectives and the corresponding general procedures of the research were:
	To develop new computational tools for automated damage identification in reinforced concrete structures using acoustic emission. Large scale reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls, instrumented with acoustic emission (AE) sensors, were tested under quasi-static cyclic loading to validate the proposed algorithms.
	To develop new advanced vision-based SHM techniques for crack pattern quantification in reinforced concrete structures. Large scale reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls were tested under quasi-static cyclic loading. High quality photos were taken at the end of each load step using a high definition camera. Crack information were extracted from the photos and a fractal analysis was used to quantify the crack patterns. Results were compared with damage grades defined in the current standards (e.g. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidebook).
	To design and validate an embedded corrosion monitoring system for post-tensioned concrete structures. An experimental setup was designed at the SSRL at the University at Buffalo to investigate the relationship between guided ultrasonic waves signals and corrosion damage characteristics, such as loss of prestressed load or broken wires.
	To investigate acoustic emission technique for the real-time monitoring of pipelines rehabilitated with cured in place lining technology. Experimental tests were carried out on the earthquake simulation system (i.e., two re-locatable shaking tables) of the SEESL at the University at Buffalo (UB). Two re-locatable shake tables were utilized to conduct static and dynamic testing on three full scale ductile-iron (DI) pipelines retrofitted with InsituMain liner. Two damage mechanisms were investigated: 1) delamination between pipeline and liner, and 2) onset of plastic response and incipient failure of the liner. 

Dissertation organization
This dissertation is organized into nine chapters followed by a list of references. Chapter 2 is an introduction to the current nondestructive testing (NDT) techniques used for civil structures. 
Chapter 3 entitled “Acoustic Emission Monitoring of a Concrete Wall” studies the acoustic emission behavior in a squat reinforced concrete shear wall and presents the results of a frequency-amplitude analysis. This chapter proposes a statistical method to estimate the onset of nonlinear behavior in the force-displacement hysteresis loops using acoustic emission. 
Chapter 4 entitled “Sifted b-value Analysis” correlates damage grades and scale of cracks (i.e., micro-cracks and macro-cracks) in a RC shear wall under quasi-static reversed cyclic loading to the AE parameters. A new method is proposed to statistically cluster AE data related to each principal crack mode (i.e., tensile and shear). To monitor the scale of cracks for each crack mode using acoustic emission, a new algorithm called Sifted b-value analysis is introduced in this chapter. 
Chapter 5 entitled “Probabilistic Crack Classification in Concrete Structures” implements an unsupervised pattern recognition algorithm to address uncertainty and cluster overlapping in crack mode classification using acoustic emission. This algorithm explicates existence of cluster overlapping and the necessity to modify a conventional understanding about crack mode classification using AE.
Chapter 6 entitled “Visual Inspection Using Fractal Analysis” presents a novel method to automate and enhance the visual inspection of reinforced concrete structures. The methodology presented here involves quantifying the erratic crack patterns to facilitate and automate decision making on the safe or unsecure operation of a reinforced concrete structure. 
Chapter 7 is titled “Corrosion Diagnosis Using Ultrasonic Waves”. This project aims at obtaining an objective understanding of Guided Ultrasonic Wave (GUW) propagation in 7-wire steel strands for developing a NDE technique for corrosion detection at early stage. The application of this method would be in monitoring and inspection of post-tensioned concrete structures and cable-stay bridges. Continuous Wavelet Transform was used to analyze the time-frequency spectrum and identify the governing frequencies that are sensitive to corrosion. Velocity of wave propagation at a certain frequency was explored to estimate extent of cross section loss. Mass loss and variation of GUW was monitored on a daily basis to correlate the extent of corrosion on the physical characteristics of GUWs.
Chapter 8 entitled “Post-Earthquake Evaluation of Pipelines Using Acoustic Emission” presents the results of an experimental study on an AE-based SHM system that remotely monitors integrity of water and waste water pipelines. A class-conditional density function was developed for AE features to detect damage indicative features. Then a multivariate outlier analysis based on Mahalanobis square distance was applied to determine the critical state of damage.
Chapter 9 contains a synopsis of the key findings and conclusions obtained from this dissertation. The references are given in Chapter 10.

 

Conventional NDE methods 

Introduction
Nondestructive evaluation (NDE) is a set of analysis tools that are applied in science and industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage to the object that is being inspected (ASTM E 1316 - 05, Section – B, Standard Terminology for Nondestructive Testing, 2005). There are several NDE methods used in forensic engineering, civil engineering, mechanical and aeronautical engineering, electrical engineering, and medicine such as ultrasonic (Aggelis and Philippidis, 2004; Bartoli et al., 2011; Rose et al., 1996), acoustic emission (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Giunta et al., 2012; Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008; Horne, 2003), liquid penetrant and magnetic-particle (International Atomic Energy Agency, 2000), eddy-current testing (García-Martín et al., 2011), radiographic (Inspection, 2008), and visual inspection (VI) (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013a; FIB, 2003a) . Nondestructive evaluation can be used for both old and new structures. In new structures, the main applications are for quality control (QC) or the resolution of hesitation about the quality of materials or manufacturing. The NDE of existing structures is often related to assessment of structural integrity. In this dissertation, the NDE methods used in assessment of existing civil structures, including visual inspection, ultrasound, acoustic emission, and infrared thermography, are briefly introduced. 



Visual inspection
In concrete structures, visual testing is probably the most important and simplest NDE. It can usually provide valuable information to an experienced engineer. In this method, it is vitally important that the engineer is able to recognize between the various signs of distress which may be exposed. These include for instance, cracks, spalling, disintegration, color change, staining, and lack of uniformity. Broad information should be collected from visual inspection to give an initial evaluation of the condition of structure and allow preparation of a successive testing program. In addition, the significance and benefits of a visual survey should not be underestimated. Often the omission of what appears to be an insignificant evidence can lead to a wrong conclusion. The advantage of a trained eye is best described by Sherlock Holmes when he wrote: “I see no more than you but I have trained myself to notice what I see.”(Doyle, 1877).

Tools and equipment
An engineer performing a visual inspection should be well equipped with tools. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) guidebook (IAEA, 2002), the following visual inspection tools listed in Table ?2 1 facilitate the assessment:
Table ?2 1 Common visual inspection tools
Accessories		measuring tapes	markers	thermometers	rulers	anemometers
Scopes	Binoculars	telescopes	borescopes	endoscopes	fibre scopes
Pictorial documentation	camera	micro lenses		polarized filters
Drawings	plan views	elevations	typical structural details	
Others	crack width gauge	portable color chart	Plan drawings		



Procedure
The first step for any visual test is to collect the relevant structural drawings, technical specifications, and construction reports to learn about the structure. The investigation should consider the present defects, the condition of adjacent structures and environmental condition (IAEA, 2002). After the relevant documents were collected, the engineer normally carries out the following tasks (Buidling and Construction Authority, 2012): 1) inspects the condition of the structure to identify the types of structural defects and material deterioration; 2) evaluates the loading on the structure to identify any deviation from intended use, which can lead to overloading. 
The inspector should clearly record the evidences. For example he has to mention whether the defects are random or possess a specific pattern and whether the problem is concentrated to certain locations or exists all over the structure. After all information is gathered, the engineer then determines the required action: retrofit, replacement, or no action. 
In concrete structures, defects that commonly need recording include (IAEA, 2002), cracking, surface pitting and spalling, surface staining, differential movements or displacements, variation in algal or vegetative growths, surface voids, honeycombing, bleed marks, exudation of efflorescence; some of them are explained as follows.

Modes of damage
Cracks
Cracks are among the most informative attributes of damage. They affect structural durability and can also facilitate air exposure which can lead to corrosion of reinforcing bars. Cracks can occur at two stages: before and after concrete hardens. Plastic shrinkage and settlement cracks as well as those appear due to movement of the formwork occur before hardening. Cracks, which appear in the concrete after it has hardened, may be due to drying shrinkage, dislocation (settlement), mechanical actions such as overload, or fatigue.
Cracks are either structural or nonstructural. Structural cracks are caused by the dead and live-load stresses. Nonstructural cracks are often caused by thermal expansion and shrinkage of the concrete and they are not considered as critical defects. Cracks are also usually classified based on their width as hairline, medium, or wide cracks (FIB, 2003b). The width of surface-breaking cracks can be visually measured at the surface. However, estimation of crack depth is still a challenging topic (Nikolakopoulos et al., 1997). In addition to width, the pattern of cracks should be considered equally important as the width of closed or partially closed cracks can deceive an inspector in case of re-centering (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013a, 2013d). Quantification of crack patterns is the main objective of Chapter 6. Figure ?2 1 shows a snapshot of a RC wall with structural cracks due to overload.

Corrosion
Corrosion is oxidation of a metal and rusting is the corrosion of iron that simply occurs in the alloy steel. Corrosion initiates through an Oxidation-Reduction electrochemical process in the presence of oxygen, water, and chlorides. Iron atoms loose electron (oxidize) via an anodic reaction and oxygen in the presence of water accept electrons (reduces) in a cathodic reaction. When the concrete surface cracks, water and oxygen penetrate and initiate corrosion in the rebars or steel strands of a concrete structure. Water can also enter the concrete by diffusion during carbonation. Upon accumulation of corrosion products (iron oxides), circumferential mechanical stress is induced. It can cause growth of more cracks and eventually disrupt the concrete structure. Hazard of corrosion is more critical for prestressed concrete structure. These structures rely significantly on the steel strands that are under extreme tensile load. Corrosion reduces the cross-section, and thus failure occurs suddenly upon instantaneous wire breakage (see Figure ?2 2)(Elfergani et al., 2013; Moustafa et al., 2014; Vélez et al., 2009, n.d.). Chapter 8 addresses this issue and studies the feasibility of using a NDE method to diagnose corrosion at the early stage.

Chemical damage
 Carbonation, leaching, intrusion of chlorides and sulfates are common forms of chemical damage in concrete structures. 
Carbonation is the combination of carbon dioxide (CO2) from air with the calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) in concrete to produce calcium carbonate (CaCO3). It is opposite of the calcination of lime that occurs in cement. Carbonation increases mechanical strength of concrete, though it decreases alkalinity, which is necessary to preserve reinforcement steel from corrosion. Chlorides, particularly CaCl2, have been shown to leach Ca(OH)2 and cause chemical alternation in Portland cement, leading to loss of strength. Sulfates and sulfites are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present from many sources such as acid rain. Solution of sulfates can chemically degrade cement and lead to serious microstructural effects that deteriorate the cement.

Thermal damage
Concrete can be injured by fire even though it is regularly used to fireproof steel structures. Concrete in temperatures below 100 °C usually remains healthy. Beyond approximately 300 °C (dependent of water/cement ratio), concrete surface becomes pink. Concrete turns light grey over 600 °C, and over nearly 1000 °C it gets a yellow-brown hue. A detailed explanation of thermal damage to concrete structures, phase transformation processes, evolution processes in pore structure, and thermohygromechanical coupled processes can be found in (Willam et al., 2005). One rule of thumb is to consider all pink colored concrete as damaged parts that should be removed. 
Limitations of visual inspection
Inaccessibility is one of the main limitations of visual inspection. There could be some difficulties in the assessment as some of the main structural elements may have been disguised by architectural covers. It is therefore important that professional judgment is exercised by the structural engineer to determine which areas that are covered up should become visible for inspection. 
More importantly, condition assessed by visual inspection is subjective in nature and depends on the experience, knowledge, expertise, and judgment of the inspector carrying out the assessment. As a result there is a potential that indications of structural degradation could be missed. More explanations along with real-world incidents will be discussed in Chapter 6.

Ultrasonic methods
Ultrasonic testing is usually used for flaw detection in steel and other metals and alloys; however, it can also be applied on concrete, wood or composites, with less resolution. In ultrasonic testing (UT), energy travels through a medium in form of stress wave. Very short ultrasonic pulse-waves with center frequencies ranging from 0.1-15 MHz are transmitted into materials using a piezoelectric-based transducer. In this section, the background knowledge as well as the current UT methods are discussed briefly.



Waves propagation in elastic solids
Most ultrasonic waves can be described in terms of harmonic (sinusodial) waves with period ? and wavelength ?. A harmonic wave has the following characteristics: 
?= the angular temporal frequency=   and f = 1/?
k= the wave number= 
Therefore the wave velocity is:
 
(?2.1)The wave function for a one dimensional traveling harmonic wave is:
 
(?2.2)where u0 is the amplitude. Taking the second partial derivative with respect to space and time, as it becomes a multiplication of u(x, t), yields:
 
(?2.3)Equation (2.3) is the linear wave equation for one dimension (Shull and Dekker, 2002).

Longitudinal mode (one-dimensional)
Assume a harmonic wave is traveling along the axis of a long, thin rod (see Figure ?2 3). The dynamic displacement is caused by the imbalance of forces (stresses) acting on the volume. Therefore,
 
Figure ?2 3 Ultrasonic longitudinal wave propagating in a long thin rod (Shull and Dekker, 2002)

 
(?2.4)and according to the Newton’s second law:
 
(?2.5)where?? is the density of the material. There is no Poisson effect because the medium is a long thin rod with a stress-free surface.
Therefore,
 
(?2.6)According to elastic constitutive law s=E?, where E is the Young’s modulus and ? is the strain or  . Substituting this relationship in (2.6) gives:
 
(?2.7)This equation is similar to (2.3) but there is a ?/E term instead of a 1/v2. Therefore, the phase velocity of a 1-D longitudinal wave in a homogeneous, isotropic medium is:
 
(?2.8)
Transverse mode (one-dimensional)
Transverse (flexural) wave is excited by applying time-varying forces to produce linear, elastic, shear stresses (Rose, 2004; Shull and Dekker, 2002). Figure ?2 4 depicts a shear wave traveling in the x-direction.
 
Figure ?2 4 Transvers wave propagation in a thin elastic rod (Shull and Dekker, 2002)

Following the same procedure for longitudinal waves, the Newton’s law gives:
 
(?2.9)and since the relation between shear stress and shear strain is,
 
(?2.10)the equation of transverse wave motion will be:
 
(?2.11)Thus, the phase velocity of a 1-D transverse wave in a homogeneous, isotropic medium is
 
(?2.12)
Waves in Three Dimensions (bulk waves)
To find the wave velocity in 3D, we should note that despite one dimensional wave, here Poisson’s effect plays a considerable role. Poisson’s ratio,??, relates the applied strain to the induced strain:
 
(?2.13)Consequently, with algebraic manipulation and including Poisson ratio, the longitudinal and transverse wave velocity in an isotropic bulk medium will be (Shull and Dekker, 2002):
 
(?2.14) 
(?2.15)This bulk longitudinal wave is also called a dilatational wave (i.e., a wave that dilates the volume). In contrast, the shear deformation causes no new elastic effects, so the volume does not change and the velocity remains identical to 1D case.
Ultrasonic testing is used in three major configurations: pulse-echo, pitch-catch, and guided ultrasonic waves; each of which will be discussed in the subsequent sections.

Pulse-echo
In pulse-echo mode, ultrasonic transducers act as emitters and receivers (Rose, 2004). Figure ?2 5 and Figure ?2 6 show the transducer in pulse-echo configuration and the recorded signal. The signal shows a wave packet arrived sooner than the back surface reflection, which is due to the flaw within the specimen. Given the velocity of wave propagation and the time of arrival of the reflection, one can easily calculate the location of flaw. In this method, sometimes the signal has to travel a long distance to get to the same sensor (i.e., twice the distance from the flaw). Therefore the signal is severely attenuated. In such conditions, another configuration called pitch-catch is used.

Pitch-catch
When operating in pitch-catch (also called through-transmission) mode, two ultrasonic transducers are used; one transducer transmits the wave and the other receives it. Pitch-catch is unable to localize the position of flaw; however, its comparison with a base-line signal can show existence of flaw. This method is useful when the location of defect is not of interest and merely the existence is to be explored. Pitch-catch and pulse-echo configurations are used in Chapter 8.
 
Figure ?2 5 Pulse-echo configuration 
 
Figure ?2 6 Pulse-echo ultrasonic signal 
Guided ultrasonic waves
When the medium in which the waves travel is confined to the surface boundary, the waves are critically refracted by the boundaries and may resonate. Guided waves are generally classified in two groups: Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs) and Bounded Waves. 
 
Figure ?2 7 Pitch-catch configuration
 
Figure ?2 8 Pitch-catch ultrasonic signal w/wo flaw

Surface Acoustic Waves (SAWs)
Surface acoustic wave was first discovered by Lord Rayleigh in 1885. SAWs generally propagate on the surface of the object and are a combination of longitudinal and shear waves. There are many different types of SAW, depending on the nature of the materials at the interfaces including Rayleigh, Scholte, Stoneley, Love, and Creeping (Shull and Dekker, 2002).

Bounded Waves
Ultrasonic waves in articles of finite size can generate bounded waves. Bounded waves are called plate waves if the structure is a multilayer, and Lamb waves if it is a single layer. Figure ?2 9 illustrates a longitudinal wave propagating at an angle through a plate. Once the longitudinal wave hits a surface, both a longitudinal and a shear wave can be reflected (Alleyne et al., 1998). When these waves reach the other surface, it splits into two additional waves upon reflection. This pattern is then repeated and inevitably approaches chaos. Though, certain resonant waves generate as the waves interact with each other. These resonant waves are either symmetric (extensional), see around the center of the plate or antisymmetric (flexural). The guided wave velocity depends on the frequency, geometry, and the vibration mode (Rose, 2004). Dispersion curves are often used to understand the wave velocity of different modes or to create a specific wave at a certain frequency. Figure ?2 11 shows the dispersion curves for phase and group velocity in a thin rod with longitudinal (L), flexural (F), and Torsional (T) modes. The dispersion equations are complicated to derive and require numerical methods to solve (Shull and Dekker, 2002).

Acoustic emission
Acoustic emissions (AE) are microseismic activities originating from sudden stress release within the test specimen when subjected to an external load. Acoustic emissions are caused by local disturbances such as cracking, dislocation, inter-granular friction, etc (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). Acoustic emission is a passive NDE method. It listens to the emitted stress waves through a number of piezoelectric transducers, which convert the acoustic signals (stress waveforms) to electric signals. Figure ?2 12 schematically illustrates AE wave propagation in a solid bar. Given the difference between the time of arrivals and the wave velocity, the location of crack can be estimated. This technique has been investigated in the past four decades for monitoring concrete structures (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013e), metallic structures (Dehghan Niri et al., 2013), and composite panels (Godin, 2004). In comparison to other NDE techniques, AE monitoring possesses the simplest physical concepts (i.e., noise due to cracking, like breaking a wood stick), but is one of the most difficult techniques to analyze as it contains significant sources of uncertainty. Three chapters of this dissertation are related to AE and thus the detailed explanations and methodologies are postponed to Chapters 3, 4, and 5.

Infrared thermography
Thermal NDE, also known as infrared thermography, is a non-destructive, non-intrusive, and non-contact mapping of thermal configurations on the surface of objects. Generally, It is used to evaluate thermal behavior, and thus, to assess the performance and the integrity of materials, products, processes, and structures. The physical concept behind this technique is that all objects warmer than absolute zero emit electromagnetic radiation energy in the infrared region of electromagnetic spectrum, which lies between visible light and radio waves (Meola and Carlomagno, 2004). 
The electromagnetic spectrum is divided arbitrarily into a number of wavelength regions, called bands, distinguished by the methods used to produce and detect the radiation. There is no fundamental difference between radiations in the different bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. They are all governed by the theory of electromagnetic waves and the only differences are those due to differences in wavelength. Figure ?2 13 shows the electromagnetic spectrum and the wavelength range for infrared waves (i.e., between 2 to 13 micrometer). 
 
Figure ?2 13 The Electromagnetic Spectrum (FLIR Systems, 2011)

Thermal imaging is a technique used for converting a thermal radiation pattern, which is not visible to the human eye, into a visual image. Infrared camera is used to obtain the thermal visual image by transforming energy radiated from object into an electronic video signal. Infrared camera creates images based on the heat energy emitted by the object rather than light reflected from it. IR thermography can be done in two modes: Passive and Active. In a passive mode, the camera monitors the object to differentiate various coordinates with associated temperature. In an active mode, a source of heat, increase the temperature of the object and the camera is used to monitor the rate of increase in temperature. This mode is often employed for material characterization and NDT purposes (Clark et al., 2003; Meola et al., 2004; Qin and Bao, 1996).




 

Acoustic Emission Monitoring of a Concrete Wall

Introduction
Reinforced Concrete (RC) shear walls are popular gravity and lateral force resisting systems. Failure of a shear wall could result in severe damage and even progressive collapse of a concrete structure. Currently the vast majority of post-event inspections are visual, and unfortunately, even with the recent advances in automated ground-based nondestructive evaluation (NDE) methods, there is a potential that indications of structural degradation could be missed. Structural safety inspections can be difficult and tedious because (1) the feature sizes for cracks and corrosion are often small with respect to the resolution of the inspection methods, (2) crucial structural details are often hidden or buried inside surrounding structure, making access difficult, and (3) inspection of structural components must include large areas with many features to inspect. For these reasons, structural health monitoring (SHM) is now an attractive choice to ensure the safe operation of civil structures. In fact, prevention of unexpected structural failure could be improved by equipping structures with sensing and analysis systems to enable real-time, continuous and autonomous monitoring. Furthermore, coupling such systems with remote facilities can overcome hundreds of inspection obstacles stemming from accessibility restrictions, complex geometries, and the location and depth of hidden damage. A technique that shows promise for monitoring concrete structures is the acoustic emission (AE) method. In general terms, AE are stress waves caused by sudden strain releases due to internal fracture such as concrete cracking (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). When material is overstressed, a burst of energy is released in the form of high frequency sound waves from propagating cracks or from plastic deformation (Rens et al., 1997). Generally, a sparse array of piezoelectric transducers is placed in contact with the structure to detect these waves. By filtering out the background noise from AE, the damage statues of a structure can be estimated. Several studies have demonstrated the ability of the AE to perform the critical tasks of detection, location and determination of the dynamics of cracks that may substantially degrade a structure and its ability to perform as intended (Salamone et al., 2011a, 2011b). Ohno and Ohtsu (Ohno and Ohtsu, 2010) proposed two crack classification methods to evaluate properly crack propagation and resultant degradation in concrete structures. One of them is a parameter-based method (parameter analysis) that has been carried out by employing two parameters of the average frequency and the RA value (i.e., the ratio of signal’s Rise time to its peak Amplitude). The other crack classification is the Simplified Green’s functions for Moment Tensor Analysis (SiGMA), which is known as a signal-based method (Ohtsu and Ono, 1984). The close similarity between AE generated by materials undergoing brittle failure and seismic waves generated by earthquakes triggered the use of seismological techniques such as b-value analysis in AE (Gutenberg and Richter, 1949; Hardy, 1972; Schumacher et al., 2010). Colombo et al. (2003) used b-value analysis as an alternative way to process and interpret data recorded by eight sensors during a laboratory test on a reinforced concrete beam and proposed some quantitative damage criteria. Kurz et al. (2006) used the b-value and the improved b-value (Ib) (Shiotani et al., 2001) on a concrete beam and a concrete cube to connect stress redistribution to b-value drop and macro-crack growth in fracture process. Experimental studies have also been performed to recognize defect size distributions in concrete structures by b-value analysis (Carpinteri et al., 2007). Schumacher et al. (2010) proposed a minimum b-value analysis to estimate the load capacity of bridge girders. Although AE-based techniques have several advantages there are still some key disadvantages to its use. The primary disadvantage is that the AE data normally contain significant high-frequency noise, primarily caused by surrounding operational conditions (i.e. temperature and environmental noise) and the measurement equipment (e.g. preamplifiers that usually amplify the surrounding noise). Statistical-based pattern recognition algorithms therefore need to be implemented to automatically extract signal features and to recognize, classify and interpret the results. This chapter investigates the monitoring of the fracture process in a large-scale RC shear wall using b-value analysis. In addition, a statistical pattern recognition technique based on an outlier analysis is proposed for identifying the initiation of serious damage of the shear wall caused by a significant change in its mechanical properties. Such a system if deployed widely could inform decision makers about the need for repair or to ensure the safe and reliable operation of critical structural systems.

Experimental Test set-up
 Test Specimen and Load Protocol
The test specimen was a large scale rectangular shear wall with a height to width ratio of 0.54, designed based on the seismic provision of chapter 21 and ACI 318-08 (ACI Committee 318, 2008). The width and thickness of the specimen were 305 cm (120 in) and 20.3 cm (8 in), respectively. The compressive strength of concrete was approximately 35 MPa (5.1 kips) after 28th day, and was 48.2 MPa (7 kips) in the test day. The horizontal and vertical reinforcement ratio was 1%. The yield and ultimate strength of the reinforcing bars were 434 MPa and 460 MPa, respectively. There were mechanical splices on the vertical rebar at approximately 35.6 cm (14 in) from the foundation. The specimen was rigidly connected to the laboratory’s foundation using 14 Dywidag bars with a 1.5-in nominal diameter. The lateral load was applied to the specimen by two horizontally inclined high force capacity actuators.  The actuators were attached to the specimen through custom made brackets and plates that were post-tensioned to the sides of the specimen. The centerline of loading was at 165 cm (65 in) inches from the base. The specimen has been subjected to a displacement controlled reversed cyclic loading. The loading protocol consisted of eleven load steps (LS). The first LS had three cycles and the subsequent LS had two cycles (C1, C2). Each cycle consisted of two phases, namely positive load peak (PLP) and negative load peak (NLP), as shown in Figure ?3 1. The loading rate was set at around 0.13 cm/sec. The wall was displaced in the plane of its web. After reaching the peak in every cycle, the actuators load was maintained for approximately twenty minutes to map cracks propagation and take photos. More details on this wall can be found in (Rocks, 2012).

 AE system
The main components of the AE system included an eight-channel high-speed data acquisition board (Physical Acoustics Corporation Micro-II PAC) and dedicated software for signal processing and storage (AEwin). The test specimen was instrumented with eight AE sensors (four R15??and four R6?), on one side of the wall. The sensors were attached to the face of the wall using hot glue. The AE sensors were used in conjunction with preamplifiers set at 40 dB gain and analog bandpass filters set in the interval of 20 kHz to 400 kHz. A trigger level can be set separately for each of the eight channels. When the amplitude of a trigger signal from anyone of the eight AE transducers exceeds the preset level, the data signals from all transducers are digitized, saved, and transferred to a laptop computer. The trigger level was set to be 6dB above the noise level of the system, which was determined as follows. The trigger level was gradually increased until the system began to capture signals continuously. This level was then taken as the noise level of the system, and the dominant source is assumed to be electronic noise in the preamplifier. During each test the output from load cells was continuously recorded and correlated with the AE signals as a parametric input. The sensor layout as well as an overview of the experimental setup are schematically shown in Figure ?3 2. Sensors were placed with spacing of 0.5m based on attenuation measurements performed through pencil lead break method (ASTM E2075 / E2075M – 10, 2010) at systematic grid locations. The estimated attenuation coefficient was about 29 dB/m.

AE-based outlier analysis
 AE technique
The AE method exploits the propagation of transient elastic waves generated by the rapid release of energy from a localized source or sources within a specific material. The elastic energy propagates as a stress wave in the structure and is detected by one or more AE sensors. AE signals may be generated by crack onset, growth and propagation, rebar breaks, debond and plastic deformations (Carter and Holford, 1998; Rens et al., 1997).  Characterizing the nature of AE sources is an open discussion in the scientific literature due to the complexity of the AE signals.  They are affected by several factors, including: 1) characteristics of the source; 2) the path taken from the source to the sensor; 3) the sensor's characteristics; and 4) the measuring system (Holford and Lark, 2005; Miller and Hill, 2005). Generally some relevant features such as maximum amplitude of the signal, energy of the signal, duration and rise time, are extracted from the AE signals to identify the sources and to evaluate their significance. Extracting parameters from the AE waveform is usually referred to as the parameter-based AE technique. In general, these features provide an indication of source intensity or severity. This is useful information for determining whether the test specimen is accumulating damage and, in turn, for deciding whether the test should continue or if the structure in question should remain in service. For example, several studies have shown that during the process of fracture of a concrete specimen there is a relationship between types of cracks and AE frequency-amplitude distribution. Micro-cracks usually generate a large number of events of small amplitude while macro-cracks generate fewer events but of larger amplitude. When the cracks are opening up, as most of the energy has already been released, many events are created, but of a small amplitude. The b-value analysis can take all these considerations into account and it can then be used to monitor the fracture in concrete structures.

 Introduction to b-value Analysis
The b-value is obtained using the frequency–magnitude distribution data by means of Gutenberg–Richter relationship (Gutenberg and Richter, 1949), which is generally used in seismology to characterize distributions of earthquake magnitude. This relationship is defined as:
log_10?N  = a – bM	(?3.1)where M is the Richter magnitude of events, N is the incremental frequency (i.e., the number of events with magnitude in the range of M ? ?M/2) (Hardy, 1972), a and b are both empirical constants to be estimated from the linear curve fitting. a is the intercept of the line with logN axis and b is the slope. The incremental frequency is also defined as the number of events with magnitude greater than M in literature (Gutenberg and Richter, 1949; Kurz et al., 2006; Shiotani et al., 2001) but the former definition is used in this article. Magnitude M is proportional to the logarithm of the maximum amplitude (Amax) recorded in a seismic trace and also to the logarithm of the source rupture area. Equation (1) has been also found to be valid for AE data, after dividing the AE peak amplitude by a factor of 20; because the AE peak amplitude is measured in dB, whereas the Richter magnitude of earthquake is defined in terms of the logarithm of maximum amplitude. Therefore, Equation (1) in terms of AE technique is modified as:
log_10?N   = a – b(A_dB/20)	(?3.2)where AdB is the peak amplitude of AE event in dB. Several studies have shown that during the fracture process in a concrete specimen there is a relationship between the type of crack and the b-value. In general, the b-value usually increases during the nucleation of micro-cracks and decreases during the subsequent coalescence of these micro-cracks with macro-cracks. The b-value analysis of acoustic emissions is in general applied to a certain number n of AE signals. Suggested values for n found in the literature range from 50 to 100 (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). However, recent studies have shown that this number n has to be verified because this parameter can influence the results (Kurz et al., 2006). To show the variability of the b-value with n, the total number of AE signals recorded during a loading cycle was divided in groups of different size (n=50, n=70, and n=100) and the range of amplitude was decided to be in steps of 5 dB from the threshold to the maximum amplitude in the group. For each group the log frequency–magnitude graph was plotted and their linear trend calculated using the least-squares method of fitting curves (Colombo et al., 2003). The slope of such curves represents the b-value. The results are shown in Figure ?3 3 as an example. It can be observed that using groups formed by a different number of events might affect the results. This variability introduces further uncertainties in the decision-making process. In addition, another issue in applying the technique is how to differentiate the AE signal of interest, that is, those due to crack growth or imminent failure, from noise of various natures in a large dataset. Often the real AE signals are measured in the presence of noise due to vibration, fretting, electromagnetic interference and automatic noise rejection is required before correlating AE activities with crack initiation or progressive failure. There is a need to develop algorithms capable of automatically classifying the level of damage despite variations in operating conditions of the structure. In constructing a SHM system that can interpret measured data and judge whether the condition of the structure has deviated substantially from its normal operational condition, a statistical approach based on an outlier analysis is proposed.

 Outlier analysis background
The Outlier analysis has been applied extensively in the field of ultrasonic testing (Bartoli et al., 2011; Kurz et al., 2006; Rizzo et al., 2010, 2009, 2007), but the use of this method to characterize acoustic emissions has not been fully investigated.  An outlier is a datum that appears inconsistent with a set of baseline data.  The baseline data describes the normal operating condition of the structure under investigation.  Ideally, the baseline data should include the statistical variation of sensitive features due to normal changes in environmental and operational conditions of the structure (e.g., temperature, humidity, loading) and can be constructed based on the AE events recorded during the first year of operation of a new structure.  For the sake of completeness, a brief introduction of the outlier analysis is provided below. For a more extensive review, the reader is referred to Barnet and Lewis (Barnett and Lewis, 1994).  In the analysis of univariate data, the detection of outliers is a straightforward process based upon the determination of the discordancy between a single observed datum and the baseline statistics.  One of the most common discordancy tests is based on deviation statistics, defined as:
z_?=|x_?-x ¯ |/s	(?3.3)where x? is the potential outlier,   and s are the mean and the standard deviation of the baseline, respectively, and z? quantifies the extent of discordance. The value of z? is then compared to a defined threshold value, to determine whether the datum x? is an outlier (i.e., above the threshold) or not. The mean and standard deviation can be calculated with or without the potential outlier, depending upon whether inclusive or exclusive measures are preferred. The inclusive manner of baseline computation was employed in this work. For this study the baseline set incorporates b-values calculated from AE measurements acquired during the first cycle of the load step 2 (LS2-C1). The b-values were extracted from each group of AE received.  For a given observation, the discordancy value, calculated using Equation (3), is compared with a threshold value in order to classify the observation as an anomaly (i.e., outlier) or normal operating conditions of the system (inlier). A Monte Carlo simulation was employed to compute the threshold. When baseline measurements are limited, a Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method for generating a large number of random data to populate the baseline distribution (Worden, 2000).

Experimental results
 Structural response
The structural response of the test specimen (SW2 (Rocks, 2012)), measured by force-displacement hysteresis loops and its corresponding backbone curve in the positive load peak (PLP) are illustrated in Figure ?3 4. In particular, since there are two cycles per load step, in Figure ?3 4a, the force-displacement hysteresis loops are shown for both first cycles (blue solid line) and second cycles (red dashed line). It can be observed that in each load step the second cycle shows less strength for a given lateral displacement. This can be due to the fact that majority of cracks are formed during the first cycle and as a result less force is required for achieving the same displacement in the subsequent cycle. Furthermore, from the backbone curve in Figure ?3 5b it can be observed that significant nonlinear behavior of the wall started from load step #8 (LS8). In LS10 the wall reached to its maximum capacity and in LS11 the wall lost significant strength. Table ?3 1 summarizes the changes in mechanical properties of the wall during the test. In particular, the second column (strength) shows the force in the corresponding peak displacement and the third column calculates the relative strength to the maximum capacity recorded in LS10. The forth column is the secant stiffness of the wall calculated by dividing the force by the corresponding peak displacement, and the fifth column is the percentage of stiffness with respect to LS2.  In the onset of nonlinearity, LS8, 19% of the peak strength remained and the stiffness decreased to 50% of the stiffness measured at LS2, as can be seen in Table ?3 1.
 Figure ?3 5 shows representative pictures of cracks developed near one of the bottom corners during different stages of the loading process. These photos were taken when the wall was in PLP of the 1st cycles. It can be observed that during the early stages of the experiment (LS1, LS2, LS3, LS4), cracks were barely visible (i.e., micro-cracks). From LS5 onwards, more visible cracks appeared and could be detected on the wall easily (i.e., macro-cracks). At LS9 the width of most of cracks was more than 1mm, and in LS10 the wall appeared significantly damaged. It can be observed that a normal visual inspection may not be able to identify the onset of nonlinearity in LS8 because after the earthquake the walls show only residual deformations and not peak deformation. Furthermore, even in peak deformation the cracks widths might be considered acceptable, as shown in Figure ?3 5. The observed fracture process has been compared with b-value analysis results in section 4.3.

 AE results
Representative results from the AE monitoring of the test specimen are illustrated in this section. Figure ?3 6 shows the amplitudes of AE signals from all sensors detected during the first and second cycle for each load step. In the data processing, the LS1 was ignored as the number of AE signals was not significant. The load history recorded by the actuators load cells (i.e., solid line) is superimposed. In the figure, it can be observed that the amplitude of the AE signals are in general higher during the first cycle (Figure ?3 6a) of each load step than that of the second cycle (Figure ?3 6b). AE are unique events and therefore not repeatable. This can be explained by noting that the second cycles have the same peak displacement as the first. Therefore, it is likely that during the first cycle of each load step, AE signals are generated mostly by the creation of new cracks, which usually generate AE signals of large amplitude. On the contrary, during the second cycle AE activity is mostly generated by aggregates crushing and propagation of the pre-existing cracks, which produce AE signals of smaller amplitude. The total number of AE signals also needs to be considered during the loading sequence. In particular, the total number of AE signals depends on whether the reload sequence is causing damage. If the reloading does not damage the structure, the number of new AE signals will be much smaller than the first cycle. If reloading damages the structure, the number of AE signals is higher (Huston, 2011).
 	 
Figure ?3 6 Peak amplitude of AE signals during the test: (a) 1st cycles; (b) 2nd cycles 

 Figure ?3 7 shows the total number of AE signals recorded during the test. In particular, it can be observed that the total number of AE signals generated during the first cycle of each load step is larger than during the second one. This observation confirms that in each load step the reloading does not damage the structure significantly but mostly cause reopening of cracks generated during the first cycle. Furthermore, an overall increase in the total number of AE signals recorded between the LS2 and the LS7 can be observed, which is likely to be related to the accumulation of damage during this stage. Interestingly, reduced AE activity was observed in the subsequent load step (LS8) in which the onset of nonlinearity was observed. This can be explained by the fact that, in this phase AE signals were mostly generated by the propagation of macrocracks that usually generate few AE signals but of large amplitude. From this load step onward, the AE activity increased exponentially until the last load step when the wall lost significant strength (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). The proximity of R-squared value to 1 verifies a relatively accurate correlation with number of AE signals and exponential functions superimposed on Figure ?3 7 for both 1st and 2nd cycles.

 b-Value results
To investigate the fracture process of the specimen during the test, a b-value analysis has been carried out, as explained in Section 3.2. Figure ?3 8 shows the mean and standard deviation of b-values calculated during the loading process of each cycle. In particular, considering that each cycle consists of PLP and NLP (Figure ?3 1), the b-value has been calculated separately during these two phases as shown in Figure ?3 8a and Figure ?3 8b. For clarity, Figure ?3 8c superposes these results. In Figure ?3 8 an overall decreasing of b-values can be observed prior to LS5 followed by a relatively constant trend until LS7 with the minimum value obtained in the LS8-NLP. At this point the applied load was approximately 81% of the peak capacity and the lateral stiffness had reduced to the 50% of the stiffness in LS2 (see Table ?3 1). Interestingly, there was no evidence of critical damage from a normal visual inspection (see Figure ?3 5). 

 	 	 
Figure ?3 8 Variation of b-value and standard deviation during loadings by load step: (a) for PLPs; (b) for NLPs; (c) for PLPs and NLPs consecutively

Figure ?3 9 shows the mean and standard deviation of b-values calculated during the unloading process of each cycle. Also in this case the b-value has been calculated separately during these two phases of PLP and NLP. A similar trend can be observed during the unloading phases of each cycle (Figure ?3 9) but the slope of reduction in the first steps is larger and the minimum value occurred in LS9. Therefore, the b-value analysis reached its minimum value when the shear wall lost its ability to perform linearly as designed (see Figure ?3 4b). Table ?3 2 summarizes the results of the b-value analysis during the loading and unloading phases. In this chapter crack status is defined: as “barely visible cracks” a condition in which the maximum and modal (i.e. the most frequent) cracks widths are less than 0.3mm and 0.2mm respectively, as “visible cracks” if they are less than 0.5mm and 0.4mm respectively and as “critical cracks” if they are larger than 1.5mm and 0.4mm respectively. More details about cracks location, orientation, and width are available in reference (Rocks, 2012).
It can be observed that the mean value, in the load steps in which the cracks are barely visible (i.e., LS1, LS2, LS3, LS4), is about 1.23 in the loading phases and 1.55 in the unloading ones. Considering that during the unloading phase AE activity is mostly generated by the crushing of aggregates or concrete-rebar friction, whereas during the loading one it is mostly dominated by cracks formation, this difference indicates that in the early stages of the load protocol the amplitude of signals generated from cracks formation is higher than that of crushing of aggregates or concrete-rebar friction. However there is no significant difference in the stage of visible cracks (i.e., 1.13 and 1.09). Finally, these values were smaller than one (i.e., 0.96 and 0.87) during the last load steps in which the specimen was visibly damaged (i.e., LS9, LS10). These results suggest that a threshold of b=1 might be used to discriminate critical structural conditions, however strong fluctuation on the b-value analysis (see Figure ?3 8 and Figure ?3 9) might significantly increase the likelihood of false positives. A b-value based outlier analysis is proposed in this chapter to reduce the number of false positive during a real-time monitoring of a RC shear wall.

Outlier analysis results
The results of the outlier analyses using the discordancy test based on deviation statistics defined in Equation 3 are illustrated in Figure ?3 10 for b-values calculated using groups of different size (i.e., n=50, n=70, and n=100). The horizontal line is the value of a threshold representing the 99.9% confidence calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation. Definition of the threshold by the Monte Carlo method sometimes assumes that the baseline data is normally distributed. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Massey, 1951) was computed to verify the Gaussian distribution of the baseline data. As can be observed the outlier analysis performs well in distinguishing b-values generated by critical conditions for the wall. In fact, the highest values of the discordance test were obtained at the point in which the shear wall lost its ability to perform linearly (i.e., LS8).  In addition, the results are independent of the group size n used to calculate the b-value. In fact, in all three cases considered, the proposed algorithm was able to automatically classify as outliers the signals received in LS8. Therefore the b-value based outlier analysis is able to detect when the shear wall is not able to perform as designed and can provide a warning prior to complete failure of the structure.

Conclusions
Post-earthquake quick damage inspection of buildings is an essential step immediately after a major earthquake to guard against life loss in aftershocks. Visual inspection is the most common form of evaluation. However there may be no outward signs that a structure has been significantly damaged after the main shock for which collapse might be imminent (Gavin et al., 2011). This work has proposed an SHM system capable of providing a rapid and automated assessment of an RC shear wall instrumented with an acoustic emission facility prior to a significant event. The proposed system will be able to operate in a dual monitoring mode: 1) real-time continuous and 2) routine-based inspections. The system is based on a sparse array of acoustic emission (AE) sensors and a statistical pattern recognition algorithm based on an outlier analysis to continuously monitor the structure under investigation. Experimental tests were carried out on a large scale RC rectangular shear wall to validate the proposed SHM system. The specimen was subjected to multiple load cycles of increasing magnitude leading to complete wall failure. AE monitoring was performed in real-time using an array of eight piezoelectric sensors. The proposed system was successfully employed to monitor the fracture process as well as to identify the instant in which the specimen exhibits a nonlinear response. The system could provide an early warning of the structure failure, and could inform decision makers of the need for repair to ensure safe and reliable structural performance. The following observation and conclusions were obtained:
	In general, the AE activity increased exponentially when the specimen was close to the failure.
	b-value analysis can be used to follow the fracture process in RC shear walls but it seems difficult to produce conclusive results.
	The overall trend of the b-value analysis is not affected by the group size used for the calculation although the value might be subjected to strong fluctuations due to normal operational condition (i.e., temperature and environmental noise). 
	b-value-based outlier analysis can be a reliable way to automatically identify critical damage conditions and reduce the likelihood of false alarm.
In the next chapter, a new method is proposed to diagnose multi-scale damage in RC shear walls. The scales of cracks and grades of damage will be compared with a filtered b-value. Then the b-value will be coupled with a systematic data clustering to segregate tensile cracks from shear-type cracks and to implement an integrated algorithm called Sifted b-value (Sb) analysis. 

 

Sifted b-value analysis

Introduction
The cracking behavior of Reinforced Concrete shear walls (RCSW) is crucial due to its harmful effects on structural performance such as serviceability and durability requirements. As explained in the previous chapter, when concrete is overstressed, a burst of energy is released in the form of high frequency acoustic waves from nucleating and propagating cracks. Characterizing the nature of AE sources is an open discussion in the scientific literature due to the complexity of the AE signals originated from uncertain sources. They are affected by several factors, including: 1) characteristics of the source; 2) the path taken from the source to the sensor; 3) the sensor's characteristics; and 4) the measuring system (Holford and Lark, 2005; Miller and Hill, 2005). Therefore, statistical pattern recognition algorithms have been proposed to automatically recognize and classify AE sources (Aggelis, 2011; Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Godin, 2004; Godin et al., 2005; Kostopoulos et al., 2003; Manson et al., 2001; Pappas et al., 1998; Salamone et al., 2011b). 
In general, some relevant features are extracted from the AE signals to characterize the source of the AE as well as to perform the critical tasks of detection, location and determination of the behavior of cracks that are likely to cause serious impairment of the structure and its ability to perform as designed. Extracting features from the AE signal is usually referred to as a parameter-based technique. Figure ?3 1 shows a typical AE signal with the most common features used during an AE testing (i.e., peak amplitude, rise-time, duration, and count). A threshold is set somewhat above the background level and serves as a reference for the waveform features. The AE peak amplitude is defined at the maximum amplitude of the signal. The number of times the signal rises and crosses the threshold is the count of the AE event. The time period between the rising edge of the first count and the falling edge of the last count is the duration of the AE event. Finally, the time period between the rising edge of the first count and the peak of the AE event is defined to be the rise time.

In the previous chapter, a classical b-value analysis has been carried out to monitor the fracture process during multiple load cycles of increasing magnitude.  It has been shown that the classical approach cannot produce conclusive results. In addition, a statistical algorithm based on an outlier analysis has been proposed to automatically identify the moment of yielding of the specimen (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d). In this chapter, three main novelties are proposed based on another experiment conducted on a larger RCSW: 1) a Gaussian filter to improve the interpretation of the b-value data obtained during the experimental test, 2)  a cluster analysis, based on the k-mean, to automatically classify the two fundamental crack modes (i.e., tensile and shear) 3) an algorithm called Sifted b-value (Sb) analysis to track the micro-to-macro crack transition stages for each crack mode. In fact, since the dominancy of shear class can be used as an early alarm, imminent failure can be prevented by selecting an appropriate rehabilitation scenario (Paterson, 2001; Priestley and Seible, 1996). The proposed algorithms have been validated during the experimental testing of a large scale RC shear wall with aspect ratio of 0.94.
This chapter is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief overview of the b-value analysis, including a description of the Gaussian filter used to smooth the results. The crack classification procedure based on the k-means analysis is then described in the “Crack Classification” followed by Sifted b-value algorithm explained in “Sifted b-value Analysis”. “Experimental Test Setup” specifies the details of the experiment and “Experimental Results” discusses the outcomes. Finally a summary of the work along with conclusive remarks is presented in the section of Conclusions.

b-value analysis
As explained earlier in Chapter 3, the b-value is obtained using frequency–magnitude distribution data by means of the Gutenberg–Richter relationship, which is generally used in seismology. The Gutenberg–Richter equation for AE is defined as follows:
 
(?4.1)where N in this chapter is the incremental frequency or  the number of AE signals with amplitude greater than AdB (compare it with definition of N in equation (3.1)), a and b are both empirical constants to be estimated from the linear curve fitting. a is the intercept of the line with logN axis, b (which is called b–value) is the slope, and AdB is the peak amplitude of the AE signal in decibels. Although AE methods based on b-value analysis show promise in monitoring the behavior of cracks in small scale RC specimens, only a few if any such methods have been transitioned to field applications. A reason for this lack of acceptance are the large fluctuations of the b-value caused by normal operating conditions of the structure (e.g., temperature variations), which makes interpreting the results extremely difficult (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d). In this chapter, a Gaussian filter is proposed to overcome this limitation. 

Gaussian Filters
Gaussian filters are often used to smooth a signal before extracting primary features. Gaussian functions have the following properties that make them particularly useful in smoothing filters (Lin et al., 1996): 1) the Gaussian function is symmetric about the mean, and the weights assigned to signal values decrease gradually with distance from the mean; 2) the width of the Gaussian function is determined by its spread parameter, i.e., the standard deviation. As the standard deviation decreases, the Gaussian function does less smoothing; on the contrary, as the spread parameter increases, the amount of smoothing is increased. 3) The local extrema (e.g., b-value drop caused by overloads) observed at one standard deviation is also observable at the smaller standard deviations and no additional local extrema are created as the spread parameter increases. This property is important when analyzing the change of local extrema across different spread parameters. The first problem in Gaussian smoothing is how to determine the spread parameter for smoothing a given vector (or time waveform). It has been shown that there is no single value of standard deviation which is universally correct (Witkin, 1984; Yuille and Poggio, 1986). In general, Gaussian smoothing is the convolution of a Gaussian window and a 1-D vector of data. The Gaussian smoothing F(x) of a signal, f(x), is defined as:
 
(?4.2)where "*" denotes convolution with respect to x, g(x,s) is the Gaussian function with the standard deviation s, and µ is a dummy variable. These filtering parameters, in addition to window span, should be properly selected to clarify the trend of the b-value.

Crack classification
In the last two decades, several efforts have been made to correlate AE features with the cracking mode in RC members, which adversely affects structural performance in various ways such as durability and serviceability. In order to utilize the performance-based concept in design more efficiently, the clarification of cracking is quite important. In general, in loading such structures until failure, tensile cracks develop at the initial stages of loading, while shear cracks dominate later (Yuyama et al., 1999). Therefore, it may be beneficial to monitor the mode of the cracks, as it can lead to a prediction of the structural performance. Japan Construction and Material Standard (JCMS-IIIB5706, 2003) proposed a technique to monitor the crack propagation in concrete structures based on two AE parameters, namely: “Average Frequency (AF)” and the “RA” value, which are defined as (see Figure ?4 1):
RA = (Rise time) / (Peak Amplitude)	(?4.3)AF = (Counts) / Duration	(?4.4)By applying these parameters, classification of cracks into tensile and other-type signals including shear cracks is performed as illustrated in Figure ?4 2 (Ohtsu, 2010). Classification based on these features produce results less dependent on the type of sensors (Ohno and Ohtsu, 2010; Ohtsu and Tomoda, 2008; Ohtsu, 2010; Soulioti et al., 2009). However, a defined criterion on the proportion of the RA value and average frequency for crack classification has not yet been confirmed (Ohno and Ohtsu, 2010). In this research, a different approach based on a k-means algorithm is proposed to automatically classify the AE signals in two dominant clusters, namely shear and tensile.

k-means Analysis
The k-means is one of the simplest unsupervised pattern recognition algorithms that can be used to solve the well-known clustering problem. The k-means aims at partitioning datasets into k disjoint subsets (clusters) based on minimization of a criterion. The most common clustering criterion is the summation of square distance of each data point in a subset to the center of the subset in which it is partitioned (Likas et al., 2003). The algorithm can be briefly described as follows:
Consider a dataset X={x1, x2, …, xN}, xn?Rd. k-means aims at partitioning this dataset into k disjoint subsets, C1, …, Ck, through minimizing the criterion or clustering error as follows (Likas et al., 2003):
 
(?4.5)where mj is the center of jth cluster, Cj, and I(X)=1 if X is true and 0 otherwise. This criterion can be minimized through an iterative procedure summarized in the following steps:
	Initializing k centers,{m1,…, mk}, through randomly dividing the dataset into k groups and calculating the mean value for each subset.
	Assigning each data point, xn, to a cluster, Cj, that its center, mj, has the lowest Euclidean distance to the point among other cluster centers. 
	Re-computing the centers for k clusters, {m1,…, mk}.
	If the change in the centers in the two preceding steps is less than a certain threshold, then the algorithm is converged and the iteration is terminated; otherwise return to step 2.
Although this method is a fast iterative algorithm, its main disadvantage is its sensitivity to the initial guess of the cluster’s centers. To overcome this issue, the algorithm was repeated 10 times with randomly selected different initial guesses and the results with the least error criterion per Eq. (5) were accepted. 


Sifted b-value (Sb) analysis
In order to monitor damage condition for each crack mode, a new algorithm called “Sifted b-value (Sb) analysis” is proposed so as to provide more detailed information about the state of cracks and integrity of the RCSW. The flow-chart in Figure ?4 3 illustrates the Sb-value analysis algorithm. It basically consists in the following steps: 1) Sieve crack modes by systematic AE clustering (i.e., k-means); 2) calculate the b-values for each cluster; 3) apply the Gaussian filtering to elaborate micro-to-macro transition stages for each crack mode.

Experimental test set-up
The test specimen was a large scale rectangular RC shear wall, named SW1, with a height to width ratio of 0.94, designed based on the seismic provisions of ACI 318-08 (ACI Committee 318, 2008). The width and thickness of the specimen were 305 cm (120 in) and 20.3 cm (8 in), respectively. The horizontal and vertical reinforcement ratio is an intermediate reinforcement ratio of 0.67%. Compressive strength of concrete on the day of the test was 24.8 MPa and the yield and ultimate strength of the reinforcing bars were 464 MPa and 708 MP, respectively (Rocks, 2012). The main components of the AE system included an eight-channel high-speed data acquisition board (MISTRAS Physical Acoustics Corporation Micro-II) and dedicated software for signal processing and storage (AEwin). The test specimen was instrumented with eight AE sensors (i.e., PAC R15?? attached to one face of the wall using hot glue. Sensors were calibrated according to the ASTM E1106-07. Pencil lead break tests were carried out at different distances away from each sensor to see if the sensors are appropriately mounted and receive waveforms (ASTM E2075 / E2075M – 10, 2010). Preamplifiers were set at 40 dB gain, analog bandpass filters were adjusted in the interval of 20 kHz to 400 kHz, and a trigger level was set to be 6 dB above the noise level of the system. The experimental setup as well as the sensor layout and load protocol is shown in Figure ?4 4. The lateral load was applied to the specimen by two horizontally inclined high force capacity actuators. The specimen was subjected to a displacement controlled reversed cyclic loading with the loading rate of 0.6 mm/sec that conforms to routine practice for earthquake testing of structural components. The loads are applied slowly because strain rate effects are generally not important for component response to earthquake shaking. Nearly all non-blast tests are performed on structural components at very low speeds of loading.  The loading protocol consisted of twelve load steps (LS). In particular, the first load step (LS0) had three cycles whereas the subsequent load steps had two cycles, as shown in Figure ?4 4c. LS0 was carried out to verify the functionality of the experimental setup; because very low AE activity was recorded during this load step, data in LS0 were neglected in the post-processing analyses. In addition, because the last load step (LS11) was a monotonic pull to failure, AE data recorded during this step were also not considered within the AE analysis in cyclic loading. After reaching the peak load in every cycle, the actuators’ load was kept constant for approximately twenty minutes to allow for the cracks to be mapped and photographs to be taken.



Experimental results
Structural response and damage states
The force-displacement hysteresis loops from LS1 to LS10 and the corresponding backbone curves are illustrated in Figure ?4 5. As can be observed, the specimen exhibited a nonlinear response in LS7 and reached its maximum capacity in LS9.

Figure ?4 5 Force-displacement hysteresis loops and backbone curves (Rocks, 2012)

Cracking patterns at the peak load of each first cycle, from LS1 to LS10, are shown in Figure ?4 6. The cracking patterns at the negative load peaks were consistent with the photographs due to the symmetric behavior of the wall; therefore they are not reported for the sake of clarity. Flexural (tensile) and shear cracks are indicated with blue and black lines, respectively. In addition, maximum and modal (i.e., appearing most frequently) crack widths are marked in each photograph with a square dot (?) and with a circle (?), respectively. It can be observed that the maximum crack width always occurred in the bottom corners of the specimen, whereas the modal cracks occurred in the diagonal cracks. 
 
Figure ?4 6 Crack positions, orientation, and mode in the positive peak of 1st cycles from LS1 to LS10; original photos from (Rocks, 2012)

The maximum and modal cracks widths are plotted in Figure ?4 7 for each load step. Micro-to-macro cracks transition stages are separated by dashed vertical line. The maximum crack width was less than 1 mm between LS1 and LS6. It can be observed that though numerous cracks were formed in the specimen during these loading steps (see Figure ?4 6), the widths of the cracks did not significantly change. Only a few number of hairline cracks could be mapped prior to load step 3. Therefore, it could be inferred that micro-cracks were nucleating in those load steps. From load steps 3 to 6, a lot of visible cracks were observed. It means micro-cracks coalesced and formed macro-cracks. This stage is called macro-cracks formation. Thereafter, the maximum crack width recorded in the subsequent load steps increased up to 3 mm in LS7 and about 4 mm in LS9, as the specimen reached its maximum capacity. This stage is called macro-cracks opening. This result will be used to interpret the b-value trends.

	Widespread crushing of concrete	LS10
	Shear cracks with widths exceeding 0.12 in. (3 mm)	LS10

Table 1 summarizes damage states (DS) observed during the test. Damage states define threshold levels of damage sustained by structural components under earthquake-type loading. Generally, the DS are characterized by direct indicators of damage such as maximum concrete crack width, extent of concrete spalling and crushing, residual displacement due to sliding shear, and reinforcement buckling and fracture (Gonzalezdelarosa et al., 2007; Gulec et al., 2010; Rocks, 2012; Sandeep Degala, 2008; Soulioti et al., 2009). 

b-value analysis results
To monitor the fracture process of the specimen during the test, a b-value analysis was carried out as explained in section of “b-value analysis”. In particular, the b-value was calculated using groups of n=70 AE signals. Figure ?4 8 shows the b-values obtained considering the AE signals recorded by sensor #2 (S2). The estimated probability density function is also indicated. Interestingly, this function fits a Gaussian probability density function fairly well, with mean and standard deviation calculated from the b-values data. As can be seen, it is very difficult to identify a trend in the b-value results; this difficulty most likely occurred because of the large amount of AE activity (mostly scattering effects) generated by the specimen under the cyclic loadings. 
 
Figure ?4 8 b-value results for sensor 2

 
Figure ?4 9 b-value results for each sensor after Gaussian filtering

Similar results were obtained by other sensors and due to space limitations, are not reported here. Considering that real-time monitoring of large structures requires the capability to elaborate large amounts of data generated from the structure during normal operating conditions, in this research it is proposed to filter the b-value data using a Gaussian moving average as described in the section of “Gaussian Filters”.1. In particular, the window span was defined as about 5% of the length of the data vector (e.g., 225 for S2 that has almost 4,500 data) while the standard deviation was set to about a quarter of the window span. Figure ?4 9 shows the outcome of the filtering process applied to all data recorded by each sensor during the test (i.e., S1-S8); the corresponding load steps are also indicated. As mentioned before, in general, the b-value increases during the formation of micro-cracks (i.e., early stages of damage) and decreases when the macro-cracks begin to localize (Colombo et al., 2003). In Figure ?4 9, a decreasing trend indicating that macro-cracks are localizing (i.e., damage accumulation) can be observed in some sensors (i.e., S1, S2, S3, S4, S6), which is shown with an arrow. A dashed line indicates the beginning of the decreasing trend. Note that this trend appears more evident for sensors 1, 2 and 3 located in proximity to the bottom corners of the specimen, where the maximum crack widths were measured (see Figure ?4 6); furthermore, it starts in LS6 or LS7, where the transition of the mechanical behavior of the specimen from linear to nonlinear occurred (see Figure ?4 5). 
Sensors 4 and 6 were mounted at 0.8 m above the first row of sensors and close to the edges of the wall where the initial flexural cracks were followed by diagonal shear cracks. A decreasing trend can be observed in sensor 4 in LS8; this could have been caused by the nucleation of a new crack in proximity to this sensor in LS8 (see Figure ?4 6) and by the opening of other cracks that increased the severity of damage in that area. A sudden drop occurred in S6 at LS9 where the wall reached its maximum capacity. Interestingly, for S4 and S6, the b-value began to decrease later than in S1, S2 and S3; therefore it is reasonable to assume that damage is progressing from the bottom of the specimen upward. The other sensors (S5, S7, and S8) do not show a clear trend in comparison to other channels. Thus, it can be concluded that most of the damage was localized in the bottom part of the specimen.
 
Figure ?4 10 b-values results for the entire dataset before filtering process

Figure ?4 10 shows the b-value results obtained considering the entire dataset (i.e., b-values obtained using data collected by all sensors) without the filtering process, along with the corresponding probability density function. Figure ?4 11 shows the outcome of the filtering process with the damage states indicated. The b-value direction is highlighted by a dashed line. 
It is interesting to compare the b-value trend with the damage states (Table 1) and progression of crack widths (Figure ?4 7). It can be inferred that as long as the maximum measured crack width was less than 0.5 mm (DS1) and micro-cracks were nucleating up to LS3, the trend generally increased, whereas formation of macro-cracks and yielding in web and boundary element reinforcement (DS2) led to a generally plateau trend with periodically oscillation around a mean value of 1.32 between LS3 and LS5. Considering that the load protocol consisted of loading and unloading cycles, it is reasonable to assume this oscillation is caused by AE activities generated by secondary AE sources including friction at the interface of the cracks and rebar-concrete during the unloading phases (i.e., b-value ascends), and formation of macro-cracks (i.e., b-value descends) during the loading phases. The opening of macro-cracks and concrete crushing mostly occurred from LS7 (DS3) onward and the corresponding b-values follow a generally descending trend. Interestingly, the minimum b-value was obtained in DS4 as the specimen reached its ultimate strength and slid against its base; that is, in LS9 (see Figure ?4 5 and Table ?4 1). An unstable b-value was observed in LS10; at this stage, the specimen was severely damaged and widths of shear cracks exceeded 3 mm. As a result, a decreasing trend of the b-value may be used as an indication of damage accumulation within the structure. The maximum, minimum, and percentage drop of b-value for the sensors that show a significant decrease and all sensors together are reported in Table ?4 2. Average and median of this percentage drop conclude the critical value of 81% as the sign of serious damage and indicator of macro-crack development.

Crack classification results
In this section, the results of the crack classification using the k-means analysis are presented. For each load step, the two features defined in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) (i.e., RA and AF) were extracted from each AE signal. A moving average with a window span and lag of 70 AE signals was carried out on these two features before the k-means analysis. 
As a result, a dataset X consisting of data points   was generated; that is,     xi?R2. Typical variation ranges of the RA value and average frequency (AF) found in the literature for concrete elements are AF=60 kHz and RA=2000 µs/V for 150 kHz resonant sensors (Gonzalezdelarosa et al., 2007; Sandeep Degala, 2008; Soulioti et al., 2009). In this research, the average frequency of the signals was about 40 kHz and the average of the RA values was in the range of 5-15 µsec/dB during the nonlinear load steps using R15 resonance transducers.
It is worthy to note that since k-means, similar to other a statistical clustering analysis, does not guarantee that each point in the same cluster was effectively generated by the corresponding crack mode. The proposed cluster analysis provides an approximation of which kind of AE events are dominant, shear or tensile. For instance, friction type signals that mostly occur during unloading have characteristics similar to shear type signals and thus they will be inevitably included in the shear cluster. However it does not impair damage state estimation based on clustering because with the evolution of damage AE activity during unloading (friction-type signals) becomes more intense. Therefore, accumulation of shear cracks and friction type signals that result in domination of shear class can be considered as indicator of damage progression (Aggelis et al., 2010; Colombo et al., 2005; Ohtsu et al., 2002; Shah and Ribakov, 2010). 
The proposed clustering analysis was applied to partition the dataset X into two subsets (i.e., k=2), named cluster 1 (i.e., tensile cracks) and cluster 2 (i.e., shear cracks). For the sake of clarity, the results of the k-means analysis are presented only for the dataset recorded in LS4 and LS5, (Figure ?4 12). From Figure ?4 12a, it can be observed that in LS4, the total number of elements in the first cluster (i.e., tensile cracks) is larger than the number of elements in the second one (i.e., shear cracks); an opposite trend can be observed in Figure ?4 12b. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that tensile cracks were dominant in LS4, whereas shear cracks were dominant in LS5. It can be seen that this method is capable of systematically classifying the dataset into two clusters without the need to manually assign a line for partitioning. Since the summation of the square distance to each center is the criterion to be minimized, the relative order of magnitude of the two features plays an important role. In this research, it is proposed to consider the dimensions of RA and AF as [µsec/dB] and [kHz], respectively. In Figure ?4 13, the total number of elements in each cluster is shown for each load step. It can be observed that tensile cracks were dominant up to LS4, whereas shear cracks became dominant from LS5 to failure. A similar conclusion may be obtained by inspection of crack patterns observed in each load step (see Figure ?4 6).

Sb-value results
In order to track the micro-to-macro crack transition stages for each crack mode, Figure ?4 14 depicts the results of the Sb-value analysis on both classes. The principal observations are as follow: 1) an initial increasing trend indicates formation of tensile micro-cracks until LS3 (Figure ?4 14a) and shear micro-cracks until LS5 (Figure ?4 14b); 2) macro-cracks opening begins in LS5 for tensile cracks and in LS7 for shear cracks; interestingly in LS7 onset of nonlinearity occurred (see Figure ?4 5). Therefore a general delay in damage progression is observed between these modes. In another word, transition conditions for tensile cracks occur earlier than shear cracks, that is, tensile cracks are followed by shear cracks. As a result, onset of decreasing trend in tensile Sb-values (LS 5 in Figure ?4 14a) could be considered as an early warning for proximity to yielding at LS7. Furthermore, both fracture modes reached their minimum b-value at LS9 where the wall disclosed its ultimate lateral strength.

Conclusions
Reinforced Concrete (RC) shear walls are popular gravity and lateral force resisting systems. Failure of a shear wall may result in severe damage and even progressive collapse of a concrete structure. In this chapter, an experimental study to monitor the fracture process in a RC shear wall subjected to cyclic loading has been described. The proposed system is based on a sparse array of Acoustic Emission (AE) sensors to continuously monitor the structure under investigation. In particular, a b-value analysis has been presented to monitor the propagation of cracks during the test. A Gaussian filter has been proposed to improve the interpretation of the b-value data. In addition, a cluster analysis based on the k-means is presented to automatically classify the two fundamental crack modes (i.e., tensile and shear). A novel algorithm called Sifted b-value analysis is introduced to provide detailed information about the damage state of each crack mode. The following observations and conclusions have been obtained:
	A Gaussian moving average has been successfully proposed to improve the interpretation of the b-value results.
	The b-value analysis was capable of identifying the damage progression in the specimen. The minimum b-value was observed when the specimen reached its maximum strength capacity.
	The cluster analysis based on the k-means was successfully applied to automatically classify the AE sources as tensile or shear cracks.
	Sifted b-value analysis could monitor the evolution of each crack mode and provide early warning for onset of yielding.
In the next chapter, a probabilistic approach is proposed for acoustic emission data clustering. The k-means algorithm is in the regime of hard assignments, meaning it labels the data to be strictly in either shear or tensile cluster. Therefore, it does not consider uncertainty. In the next chapter, it is explained how we can associate a likelihood to each data point and then classify the data based on the probability of belonging to each cluster of tensile and shear, and keeping the rest in another cluster named mixed.
 

Probabilistic Crack Classification in Concrete Structures

Introduction
Over the past century, reinforced concrete (RC) has been widely used in civil structures such as buildings, bridges, nuclear power plants or dams whose performance and function are vital to the security of our society. Unfortunately, many of these structures are facing an increasing number of challenges such as aging or natural events (i.e., earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami) that can jeopardize their safety and serviceability. To secure the overall soundness of these structures, proper assessment is crucial. In particular, cracks are of large interest in engineering practice, since their properties reflect not only the condition of concrete as a material but also the condition of the entire system at the structural level. Methodologies based on acoustic emission (AE) offer an attractive solution for monitoring the nucleation and growth of cracks in RC structures. AE are stress waves caused by sudden strain releases, such as internal fractures or concrete cracking (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). In general, a sparse array of piezoelectric transducers is placed in contact with the structure to detect these waves while some features are extracted from the detected AE signals to assess its structural integrity. Extracting features from AE signals is usually referred to as parameter-based technique. A threshold is used as a reference for the AE features. In general, this threshold is set somewhat above the background noise. Some of the most common features include: peak amplitude, rise-time, duration, and count (see Figure ?5 1). For a complete explanation of these features, an interested reader can refer to the previous chapter. 
The past few years have seen a surge of research aimed at determining functional or correlation interdependencies between crack characteristics and AE features (Carpinteri et al., 2007; Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Ohtsu, 2010; Salamone et al., 2011a, 2011b; Vanniamparambil et al., 2012), including b-value analysis (Farhidzadeh and Salamone, 2012; Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Kurz et al., 2006; Shiotani et al., 2001); source localization (Gross et al., 1997), and AE energy (Benavent-Climent et al., 2011; Colombo et al., 2005). In general, in loading concrete structures until failure, tensile cracks as a result of pure tensile stress develop at the initial stages of loading, while shear cracks dominate later (Yuyama et al., 1999). Therefore, it may be beneficial to monitor the mode of cracks, as it may lead to a better prediction of the structural performance and eventually provide an early warning for the planning and implementation of remedial actions to the structure at a point where it is less expensive and invasive than when its structural performance has been seriously compromised.
In this chapter a new approach based on a Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) is presented to perform crack mode classification in RC structures. GMM is an unsupervised distribution-based classification technique (Bilmes, 1998) that has been successfully used in many fields, including sound recognition (Reynolds et al., 2000; Reynolds and Rose, 1995), image processing (Permuter et al., 2006), dynamical systems and tracking (Povinelli et al., 2004; Stauffer and Grimson, 1999; Terejanu et al., 2008), and text recognition (Richiardi and Drygajlo, 2003); however the use of this technique for AE-based SHM has not been investigated.
This chapter is organized as follows: in the next section we briefly discuss the crack classification method developed by the Japan Construction and Material Standard (JCMS) (JCMS-IIIB5706, 2003) for RC structures, and its shortcomings are highlighted. The theoretical aspects of the GMM algorithm are then described. The following sections describe the experimental study used to validate the proposed algorithm along with the results. At the end, conclusions are summarized.

Conventional crack mode classification
In the last years, several efforts have been made to correlate AE features with the cracking mode in RC members (Aggelis et al., 2011; Beck et al., 2003; ElBatanouny et al., 2012; Farhidzadeh et al., 2013c; Ohno and Ohtsu, 2010; Shigeishi, 2001). Cracks can adversely affect structural performance in various ways such as durability and serviceability. A methodology for monitoring the crack propagation in RC structures has been proposed by the JCMS. This methodology is based on two AE parameters, namely: “Average Frequency (AF)” and “RA” value, which are defined as (see Figure ?5 1):
RA = (Rise time) / (Peak Amplitude)	(?5.1)AF = (Counts) / Duration	(?5.2)According to the JCMS, AE sources can be classified into tensile cracks and shear cracks, based on the relationship between RA values and average frequencies, as shown in Figure ?5 2. However, a defined criterion on the proportion of these two parameters has not been confirmed yet (Ohno and Ohtsu, 2010). In fact, AE measurements are mostly random data and in general non-linearly separable. Therefore, the distribution characteristics of the data set should be considered for developing a more robust classification algorithm. In this chapter, a new probabilistic approach based on a Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) is proposed to take into account data distribution properties and classify AE sources in two dominant clusters, namely shear and tensile.

Gaussian mixture modeling
A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is a parametric probability density function represented as a weighted sum of M component Gaussian densities. For a D-dimensional measurement, training, or feature vector , the mixture density is defined as (Reynolds and Rose, 1995):
 
(?5.3)where  are the mixture weights and  ?are the unimodal component Gaussian (Normal) densities. Each component density is a D-variate Gaussian function of the form:
 
(?5.4)with D×1 mean vector  , and D×D covariance matrix . The mixture weights satisfy the constraint that  .The complete Gaussian mixture model is parameterized by the mean vectors, covariance matrices and mixture weights from all component densities. These parameters are together represented as:
 
(?5.5)For a GMM-based classification system, the goal of the model training is to estimate the parameters of the GMM, ?, so that the Gaussian mixture density can best match the distribution of the feature vector . The next step is to find the best estimate for ?.
Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation is one of the most popular and well-established methods available for estimating ?i, , and ?i. The aim of ML estimation is to find the model parameters, which maximize the likelihood of the GMM given the training data. For a sequence of T training vectors , the GMM likelihood, assuming independence between the vectors, can be written as:
 
(?5.6)Due to non-linearity of this expression as a function of  , direct maximization (i.e., setting first derivative equal to zero and constraining the second derivative to be positive) is not computationally tractable. Instead ML parameters can be obtained iteratively by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).
The EM algorithm is an iterative procedure that maximizes the likelihood generated by each GMM (Hastie et al., 2008). The basic idea of the EM algorithm is beginning with an initial model ?k, then estimate a new model ?k+1, such that  (Reynolds and Rose, 1995). The new model then becomes the initial model for the next iteration and the process is repeated until some convergence threshold is reached (i.e., 10-6 for log-likelihood). This algorithm consists of two steps, Expectation and Maximization, which guarantees a monotonic increase in the model’s likelihood value (Dempster et al., 1977). The expectation step results in the a posteriori probability for component i, which is defined as the probability that the state is i and that the mth Gaussian mixture accounts for the observation   given the kth re-estimated model ?k:
 
(?5.7)The maximization step returns the distribution parameter with these components (Reynolds and Rose, 1995):
 
(?5.8) 
(?5.9) 
(?5.10)The use of a GMM may be motivated by the intuitive notion that the individual component densities may model some underlying set of hidden classes (Rabiner and Juang, 1986; Rammohan and Taha, 2005; Reynolds and Rose, 1995). This possibility motivates application of GMM for crack mode classification in concrete structures with two hidden classes, that is, shear and tensile crack (i.e., M=2) in a two-dimensional measurement vector,  .
To implement a system for crack mode classification in concrete structures, the features (or measurement) is a 2D vector (i.e., ), the sequence of T training vectors is  and the latent or hidden classes are i={1,2} for tensile and shear mode, respectively. We aim at estimating the parameters of the GMM, (weight, mean, and covariance matrix for each hidden class), which best matches the distribution of the training feature vectors. The overall procedure can be summarized as:
	Initializing the parameters in ?. The initial guess of the parameters of the state-dependent Gaussian mixtures is obtained using vector quantization with two codes (Zhou et al., 2009).
	Applying Equation (5.7) to get  
	Using  to compute a better estimate for the parameter ?k+1, (i.e., applying Equation (5.8) to (5.10) ).
	Iterating steps 2 and 3 until convergence.

Experimental study
The test specimen was a large scale rectangular RC shear wall with a height to width ratio of 0.94, designed based on ACI318-08, chapter 21, earthquake-resistance structures (ACI Committee 318, 2008). The width, thickness, and effective height (from foundation to the centerline of loading) were 305 cm (120 in), 20.3 cm (8 in), and 287 cm (112.8 in), respectively (Rocks, 2012). The horizontal and vertical reinforcement ratios were 0.67%. Compressive strength of concrete on the day of test was 24.8 MPa and the yield and ultimate strength of the reinforcing bars were 464 MPa and 708 MPa, respectively (Rocks, 2012). The main components of the AE system included an eight-channel high-speed data acquisition board (Physical Acoustics Corporation Micro-II PAC) and a dedicated software for signal processing and storage (AEwin). The test specimen was instrumented with eight R15a sensors with resonance frequency of 150 kHz and operating frequency range of 50-400 kHz. They were attached to one face of the wall using hot glue. Preamplifiers were set at 40 dB gain, analog bandpass filters were adjusted in the interval of 20 kHz to 400 kHz, and the threshold level was set to 35 dB. 
The experimental setup and load protocol are shown in Figure ?5 3. The lateral load was applied to the specimen by two horizontally inclined high force capacity actuators. The specimen was subjected to a displacement controlled reversed cyclic loading with loading rate of 0.6 mm/sec. The loading protocol consisted of eleven load steps (LS). In particular, the first load step (LS0) had three cycles whereas the subsequent load steps had two cycles. LS0 was carried out to verify the functionality of the experimental setup. The crack classification analysis was carried out using data recorded between LS2 and LS9. In fact, a very low AE activity was recorded prior to LS2, whereas in LS10 the specimen was severely damaged resulting in a significant amount of AE activity mostly due to concrete spalling, wall-foundation sliding, and rebar yielding.

The force-displacement hysteresis loops and the corresponding backbone curves are illustrated in Figure ?5 4. An initial lateral stiffness reduction of the specimen, caused by the nucleation of micro- and hairline cracks (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013c; Rocks, 2012), was observed after LS2. In a previous work, authors demonstrated, using Sifted b-value (Sb) analysis (Farhidzadeh and Salamone, 2012; Farhidzadeh et al., 2013c), that a micro-macro crack transition occurred in LS3. Then the wall behaved linearly up to LS6. Significant nonlinear response occurred in LS7, and finally, the wall reached its ultimate strength at LS9. 
Figure ?5 5 exhibits cracking at peak deformation of the first cycle in load steps 2, 5, and 9 to manifest the development of cracks orientation and positions. The cracking patterns at the negative load peaks were consistent with these pictures due to the symmetric behavior of the wall. Tensile (horizontal) and shear cracks (diagonal) are mapped on the photography by solid and dash lines, respectively. In the initial load steps the cracks started from tensile mode and then they were followed by diagonal shear cracks in the intermediate load steps. The diagonal cracks became dominant at the final load steps (see LS9 in Figure ?5 5). In addition, maximum and modal (i.e., appearing most frequently) crack widths are marked in each picture with a square dot (?) and with a circle (?), respectively.

Probabilistic crack mode classification
In this section, the results of the crack classification using the proposed GMM algorithm are presented. For each load step, the two features defined in Equation (1) and Equation (2) (i.e., RA and AF) were extracted from each AE signal detected. Then, a moving average with span and lag of 70 hits was carried out to reduce scatter (Aggelis, 2011; Ohtsu, 2010; Soulioti et al., 2009). As a result, the dataset X, consisting of data points   was generated, that is, .

Bayesian information criterion
In order to apply the GMM algorithm, the number of classes should be defined. The sufficiency of two dominant clusters selected in this work, can be investigated using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) that is:
 
(?5.11)in which L is the maximized value of the likelihood function for the estimated model, T is the number of observations, and k is the number of free parameters to be estimated for each GMM. The BIC criterion provides a tradeoff between model accuracy and complexity of the model. It should be noticed that ideally the data set can be fitted more accurately by increasing the number of mixture components. However, this leads to the estimation of more number of parameters and hence, increases model complexity. Furthermore, this can also lead to over fitting the data and experiment noise. BIC can help to select the optimum number of clusters required while maintaining a balance between accuracy and model complexity. Figure ?5 6 illustrates the variation of BIC by additional number of clusters for each load step. It can be observed that from one cluster to two clusters the BIC decreases significantly and follow a fairly constant trend by including additional clusters. Moreover, in order to explore the efficacy of adding a cluster with a better resolution, the BIC change ratio ( ) is calculated according to the following equation when M component Gaussian densities increase to M+1:
 
(?5.12) 
 Figure ?5 6 Bayesian Information Criterion for each load step	 
Figure ?5 7 Percentage of reduction in BIC by adding one cluster to the previous number of clusters.

where BICM is the BIC with M mixture components. Figure ?5 7 depicts the variation of  versus additional mixture component. The BIC reduces from one cluster to two clusters ranging from 4% to 11% depending on the load step with an average of 6%. However this reduction is not significant in any load step by adding another mixture component because the improvement is less than 3%. Therefore, considering the computation expenses, two clusters can efficiently fit the data distribution. This outcome is consistent with other studies in which the selection of two clusters have been suggested (Aggelis, 2011; JCMS-IIIB5706, 2003; Ohno and Ohtsu, 2010; Ohtsu, 2010).

Adapting GMM for conventional classification
To compare the outcome of GMM versus conventional JCMS approach, Figure ?5 8 illustrates the feature vector X recorded during the LS2 as an example. As is said earlier, the conventional classification scheme (Figure ?5 8a) does not provide a well-established criterion to define the separator line, here indicated by dashed lines; therefore this method cannot provide conclusive results. On the other hand, Figure ?5 8b displays the contour plot of the Gaussian mixture density function.

(b)
Figure ?5 8 Average Frequency vs. RA at LS2 (a) ambiguity about separator line based on JCMS code (b) GMM result and the newly defined separator line

The following observations can be made from this figure: 1) despite of Figure ?5 2 that implies two mutually exclusive categories of shear and tensile, it can be observed that these classes are intersected and have a mixed Gaussian density function (with a larger weight for the tensile class in this load step); 2) Although a straight line may not be an appropriate boundary for classification , the GMM can smooth the path toward identifying the optimum discriminator line which is simply the segment bisector of a virtual line connecting the means of the two classes (dash-dot line). In this chapter, however, a new criterion will be later proposed instead of a straight line to discriminate the two classes. 

Selection of averaging span 
To illustrate the effect of the window span size on the GMM results, Figure ?5 9 shows the feature vector X in LS2 obtained using different window span sizes (i.e., n=30, n=50, n=70, n=100) and its corresponding GMM results. It can be observed that, although the span of the moving window reduce the number of data (Figure ?5 9a, c, e, and g), the shape of the GMM results and the estimated mixture weights  are not significantly affected.

GMM results
To monitor the overall behavior of the wall during the experiment, the results of the GMM for the load steps 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are illustrated in Figure ?5 10. These results were obtained using data from all eight sensors. The red regions represent higher probability density all the way through the blue regions which depict smaller densities. The tensile and shear classes are encircled by dashed ellipses representing the confidence interval of 0.9. By definition, confidence interval gives an estimated range of values which is likely to include an unknown population parameter and vary between 0 and 1. Three stages can be identified in Figure ?5 10: i) the dominance of tensile cracks during the initial load steps (i.e., LS2 and LS3). In these load steps, the concentration of feature vectors is around the mean of the tensile class.  ii) A transition stage from tensile to shear in intermediate load steps (LS5 and LS6). In this stage, the high probable area is gradually moving toward the mean of the shear class.  iii) Dominance of shear cracks at the final load steps (LS7 and LS9). In this stage, the most likely area is concentrated around the mean of the shear class.
Another equally interesting observation is that during the initial loading steps (i.e., LS2 and LS3), the RA components in the shear class are widely distributed, between 0 and 60 µsec/dB. This is likely due to the fact that micro-cracks that are generally nucleated during small levels of loads generate AE signals with small amplitudes; this results in larger RA values (see Equation (1)). On the other hand, during intermediate and larger loadings (i.e., LS4 onward), the signals are generally of higher amplitudes and consequently RA value varies in a smaller range.

Figure ?5 10 GMM of feature vectors in load steps 2, 3 (dominance of tensile class), 5 and 6 (Transition stage), 7 and 9 (dominance of shear class)
To show the sensitivity of the proposed approach to the sensor location, Figure ?5 11 and Figure ?5 12 show the GMM results for each sensor at LS2 and LS9, respectively. Figure ?5 11 shows that all sensors mostly received tensile signals in LS2 which is consistent with the results shown in Figure ?5 10a. Figure ?5 12 shows that the overall dominant mechanism in LS9 is shear; however, it can be observed that some sensors (i.e., S1, S2, and S6) indicate a higher probability of tensile mode. These are the sensors closer to the edges and bottom corners of the specimen where the flexural cracks are dominant as shown in Figure ?5 5. Therefore, sensor-based GMM may estimate the region of flexural and diagonal shear cracks given the sensor location.

Likelihood ratio test

To improve the classification results, a new criterion is proposed to define the cluster boundaries by keeping the data points with higher likelihood into the tensile or shear cluster, and associate the rest of data to another cluster namely “Mixed”. At this aims, the likelihood ratio test is used as follow: 
 
(?5.13)where ? is the likelihood ratio and like(X) is the final maximized likelihood in GMM algorithm. Now the boundary of clusters can be simply defined by certain values of ?, i.e.,   and  for tensile and shear, respectively. In this work the data points in which the likelihood of being tensile is more than twice the likelihood of being shear are clustered in tensile class. Therefore,  =-2ln(2)=-1.4 is selected as a boundary of tensile class; likewise, the boundary for shear class is defined by data points in which likelihood of being shear is twice the likelihood of being tensile (i.e.,  =-2ln(1/2)=1.4).

Figure ?5 13 illustrates how the new criterion enhanced the classification by providing an additional option for the operator to select a desired likelihood ratio. The blue diamonds (?) are associated to the data in which the likelihood of belonging to the tensile mode is twice the likelihood of belonging to the shear mode. The black dots (.) is called “Mixed” cluster since it includes the data with less probability of being associated to a specific clusters. The red circles (?) are the data with likelihood higher than twice the likelihood of being tensile.
 
Figure ?5 13 Data selection with higher probability in each cluster in LS6

To track the classification results for all load steps, the number of AE activities associated to each cluster is shown in Figure ?5 14. It can be observed that, from load step 2 to 4, the majority of AE signals were generated by nucleation of tensile cracks (solid lines in Figure ?5 5). In load steps 5 and 6, the amount of shear cracks began to surpass tensile cracks; this is called transition stage. Finally, a growth of shear cracks was observed in load steps 7 to 9. Moreover, by comparing these results to the force-displacement hysteresis loops (Figure ?5 4), the following observations can be made: the proposed algorithm shows large AE activity associated to shear mode at the LS7 in which the onset of yielding was observed; then an increase in tensile signals was observed at LS8 due to both nucleation of few additional flexural cracks at the edges of the specimen, and mechanism of brittle fracture in compression at the bottom corners (Rocks, 2012); in fact under compressive loads, brittle materials generally fail by the formation of tensile micro-cracks at micro-defects such as cavities and grain interfaces (Nemat-Nasser and Hori, 1993). Finally at LS9 in which the wall reached its ultimate strength, the GMM indicated significant increases in the population of shear type signals. 
Table ?5 1 summarizes the percentage of data in each cluster to the total data set in each load step and the associated drift ratio at loading centerline. Based on these observations, a SHM system could be designed for similar structures by defining a threshold on the percentage of shear mode signals. To find this threshold, more specimens should be tested; however, a percentage threshold of 60% for shear class seems reasonable in this study. It highlights yielding and ultimate strength at drift ratios of 0.62% and 1.3%, respectively. Therefore, as the percentage exceeds this threshold, an early alarm could be triggered as an indication of significant damage. Thereafter, imminent failure should be prevented by applying an appropriate retrofitting scenario (Bracci et al., 1997; Paterson, 2001; Priestley and Seible, 1996). 

Modified scheme of JCMS classification
In addition, this classification scheme allows visualizing how much the classes are intersected. For instance, in LS2, LS7 and LS9 the dominancy of one class of signals is comprehensible while during transition stages (LS5 and LS6) these two classes are highly intersected. Based on these observations we propose a new classification scheme, as shown in Figure ?5 15. The intersection area can be considered as mixed crack mode (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013b).

Conclusions
In this chapter a new approach based on a Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) was presented to perform crack mode classification in RC structures. To validate the proposed system an experimental study was carried out on a full-scale reinforced concrete shear wall subjected to a displacement controlled quasi-static reversed cyclic loading. The test specimen was instrumented with eight AE sensors. During testing two features were extracted from each AE signal detected, that is, RA value and average frequency (AF).These features were used to populate a data set X; then the proposed GMM algorithm was used to partition the data set X in two clusters, tensile and shear. The GMM algorithm was capable to identify three stages during the test: 1) a dominance of tensile (flexural) cracks during the initial load steps, 2) a transition stage during the intermediate load steps, and 3) a dominance of shear cracks during the final load steps. These results were validated by visual inspection. Moreover, a new criterion based on a likelihood ratio test for enhancing crack classification was proposed. Future work should investigate the effects of geometry, specimen ductility, loading rate and sensor layout.
This chapter concludes the contribution of this dissertation on acoustic emission monitoring of reinforced concrete structures. The next chapter presents a new vision-based NDE method. Visual inspection is the main damage assessment technique for concrete structures around the world. Next chapter first addresses a critical issue in crack width measurements as a typical visual inspection method and proposes a remedy by incorporating the crack patterns in decision making process. A new method based on fractal analysis of crack patterns is introduced to quantify the erratic crack patterns.

 

Visual inspection Using Fractal Analysis 

Introduction
Civil structures such as buildings, bridges, nuclear power plants or dams include reinforced concrete (RC) structures whose performance and functionality is essential. Unfortunately, many of these structures are facing an increasing number of challenges that can jeopardize their safety and serviceability. Some of these challenges, such as aging and maintenance, are life-cycle related and expected. Other challenges such as man-made hazards or natural events (i.e., earthquakes, hurricanes and tsunami) are not expected and can weaken and destabilize a structure. Currently, assessing the performance and safety of civil structures relies on routine-based visual inspection (VI); unfortunately, condition assessed by VI is subjective in nature and depends on the experience, knowledge, expertise, and judgment of the inspector carrying out the assessment. As a result there is a potential that indications of structural degradation could be missed (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; IAEA, 2002). Notable examples of such unanticipated failures that have exposed shortcomings in condition assessment methodologies can be found worldwide: 1) August 2009, the viaduct of the Belfast-Dublin railway line collapsed, although less than a week before an engineer inspected the viaduct and found “no visible structural issues” (RAIU, 2010); 2) the Canterbury television building in Christchurch, New Zealand, collapsed during the magnitude 6.1 earthquake on February 2011; the building was inspected by engineers after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake on September 2010 and after the 4.9 magnitude aftershock on December 2010 (DBH, 2011; Gavin et al., 2011). However, it collapsed after the 6.3 magnitude earthquake on February 2011. On both occasions, the building was declared safe, having suffered only superficial damage; the 115 who died in that building alone accounted for nearly two-thirds of the 181 victims (DBH, 2011).
Various condition-rating scales have been developed worldwide to overcome the qualitative nature of VI-based condition assessment such as the International Atomic Energy Agency guidebook (IAEA, 2002), National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS, 1996), and The Federal Highway Administration code (Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 1995). These scales usually provide quantified condition in terms of visible distress attributes such as cracks, surface pitting, spalling, delamination, wear or abrasion, concrete color change, etc. In particular, cracks are of large interest in RC structures, since their properties, such as width, reflect not only condition of concrete as material but also the condition of the entire system at structural level. Crack width is commonly used as a convenient indicator of damage to RC elements, but it should be noted that recent standards and studies list other factors, such as distribution and pattern of the cracks to be equally important in measuring the extent of damage present in the structure (ATC-43, 1998; Chen and Hutchinson, 2010; Sohn et al., 2005). The pattern of cracking at any point in time provides a window into the flow of forces at lower load levels, whether a member exhibits flexure or shear dominated behavior (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013c, 2013e), the change in directions of loading after cracking, the effectiveness of steel reinforcement, stress in the reinforcements, if there are anchorage problems, and other forms of information (ATC, 1998; ATC-43, 1998). To reduce the subjectivity and variability associated with manual VI, automatic vision-based surface crack detection methods have become a center of several researches in recent years (Carpinteri et al., 1997; Chen and Hutchinson, 2010; Issa et al., 2003; Jahanshahi and Masri, 2012; Sohn et al., 2005). Although these methods can successfully detect cracks on concrete surfaces, very few if any have the ability of assessing the impact of these cracks on the overall capacity of the structure. Since the state of cracks contains an intrinsic complexity due to erratic damage mechanism of concrete, conventional mathematical or statistical theories cannot accurately differentiate damage states (Farhidzadeh et al., 2014b). In this chapter a different approach based on the fractal analysis of crack patterns is proposed to assess the structural integrity of complex structures.
Fractal analysis is a new scientific paradigm that has been used successfully in many applications, including micro-crack characterization in brittle materials (Carpinteri and Yang, 1996), fracture of rocks (Kulatilake et al., 1997; Lee et al., 1990), cracking in concrete material (Carpinteri and Cornetti, 2011; Carpinteri et al., 2012, 2009; Chiaia et al., 1998; Issa et al., 2003; Saouma and Barton, 1994) and crack propagation in reinforced concrete structures (Cao et al., 2006; Sun et al., 2011). However, its application in the structural health monitoring (SHM) community has not been fully exploited. This chapter is organized as follows: A brief introduction on the theory of fractal analysis is first presented and subsequently, a damage index developed on the basis of a fractal dimension is proposed to elaborate, facilitate, and enhance interpretation of damage states. Experimental results are also presented with application to the damage assessment of two large-scale reinforced concrete shear walls (RCSWs) under lateral cyclic loading.

Fractal analysis
Background
The term “Fractal” was first introduced by Mandelbrot (Mandelbrot, 1982) to indicate objects whose complex geometry cannot be characterized by an integer dimension. A classical example to illustrate this technique is the ‘‘length” of a coastline (Carpinteri et al., 1997). When measured at a given spatial scale d, the total length of a crooked coastline L(d) is estimated as a set of N straight line segments of length d. Because small details of the coastline not recognized at lower spatial resolutions become apparent at higher spatial resolutions, the measured length L(d) increases as the scale of measurement d increases. Therefore, in fractal geometry the Euclidean concept of “length” becomes a process rather than an event, and this process is controlled by a constant parameter called fractal dimension (FD). The FD can be a non-integer number varying depending on the complexity of an object. For example, the FD for a curve will lie between 1 and 2, depending on how much area it fills (Dubuc et al., 1989). Similarly, the FD of surfaces lies between 2 and 3 depending on the roughness of surface (Issa et al., 2003). The complexity of two curves or two surfaces can then be easily compared, as the values of FD are not anymore restricted to the topological dimensions of 1 and 2. Several algorithms have been proposed for the calculation of the FD, including the box-counting algorithm, Hurst R/S analysis, fractional Brownian motion, and the power spectrum method (Esteller et al., 2001; Mandelbrot, 1982; Taylor and Taylor, 1991; Theiler, 1990). Among them, the box-counting algorithm is the most popular (Theiler, 1990).

 Box counting algorithm
The box counting method is motivated by the approach of considering the space filling properties of the curve as an indication of its complexity. In this approach, the curve is covered with a collection of square boxes, and the number of elements of a given size r is counted to see how many of them are necessary to completely cover the curve. As the size of the area element approaches zero, the total area covered by the area elements will converge to the measure of the fractal dimension (Carpinteri and Yang, 1996; Hadjileontiadis and Douka, 2007; Issa et al., 2003; Long, Q. Y., Suqin, L. and Lung, 1991; Raghavendra and Dutt, 2010; Shoupeng and Peiwen, 2007). This can be expressed mathematically as:
 
(?6.1)where N(r) is the total number of boxes of size r required to completely cover the curve and D is the fractal dimension of the curve. In practice, D is estimated by fitting a straight line to the log-log plot of N(r) versus 1/r over a range of box sizes. This can be expressed as:
 
(?6.2)where C is a constant. The slope of the least square fit line is taken as an estimator of the fractal dimension (D) of the curve. The selection of the range of box sizes is crucial. Figure ?6 1 illustrates a typical structure of a graph of log(N(r)) vs. log(1/r) for the fractal analysis of a 2D object. It can be observed that, five possible regions can be identified: (1) if r is much larger than the size of the object, RO, (i.e., the box always cover the object so N(r) =1) then D=0; (2) if r is very larger than the size of structure in the object, RS, (e.g., if r is larger than any cracks in a picture, then the boxes required to cover the cracks will fill the whole surface) thus D=2 as for an area; (3) this is the region from which the box sizes should be selected to give the best estimation of fractal dimension; (4) in this region the transition from the Fractal to Euclidean regime occurs. The size of r in this region is called RT in this chapter. In fact, the fractal (disordered) regime at the small scales transits towards a Euclidean regime at large scales (Carpinteri et al., 1997; Mandelbrot, 1985). By definition, the scale of an image is the ratio of a distance on the image to the corresponding distance on the specimen (e.g., an overall view photo of an object has a smaller scale than a zoomed photo); (5) finally if r is smaller than the discretization size, RD (e.g., sampling frequency) D=0 as is the dimension of a point.
 
Figure ?6 1 Variation of fractal dimension versus box sizes

An example on simulated crack patterns
Figure ?6 2 shows variations of fractal dimension (D) for different simulated crack patterns. In particular, Figure ?6 2(a) depicts simulated cracks patterns with coarse mesh size. The gray boxes are the ones which contain at least one segment of a crack. Figure ?6 2(b) shows how N(r), changes for different box sizes and Figure ?6 2(c) illustrates the calculation of D for each simulated pattern. As expected, the fractal dimension (D) of a line (left column) is equal to one. Interestingly, D for four parallel lines (D=1.17) is less than the same lines grouped into a diamond shape (D=1.21). When a cross is added, it produces more total length and more surface coverage. Therefore, it causes a jump in D from 1.21 to 1.42. As a result, one may infer that crack patterns with relatively larger values of D may correspond to structural elements significantly damaged.

 Proposed damage index 
In order to include the proposed approach in a Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) strategy for estimating the level of damage in RC structural elements, a new damage index (DI) is defined as follows:
 
(?6.3)where Di is the fractal dimension of the current status of visible cracks, (e.g., in the ith inspection); D1 is the fractal dimension computed during the first inspection (e.g., once the cracks become visible for the first time). DI varies between 0 and 1 and describes the difference between the current status of crack patterns and the baseline D1. The constant “2” in the denominator is the maximum value of fractal dimension for surface cracks (i.e., when cracks cover the whole area of the concrete D tends to 2). 
Experimental setup
The test specimens were two large scale rectangular shear walls, named, SW1 and SW2, designed based on the ACI 318-08, chapter 21, earthquake-resistance structures (ACI Committee 318, 2008) with a height to width ratio of 0.94 and 0.54, respectively (Farhidzadeh and Salamone, 2012; Farhidzadeh et al., 2012). The experimental setup is shown in Figure ?6 3 and specimens’ characteristics are summarized in Table ?6 1. 
Each specimen was rigidly connected to the laboratory’s foundation using 14 Dywidag bars with a 1.5-in nominal diameter and subjected to a displacement controlled reversed cyclic loading in the plane of its web. The lateral load was applied by two horizontally inclined high force capacity actuators. The actuators were actively controlled by master-slave method to ensure a synchronized and symmetric lateral loading on the wall. The two actuators were inclined by an angle of 9 degree to prevent out of plane deformation. The actuators were attached to the specimen through custom made brackets and plates that were post-tensioned to the sides of the specimen (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d). The centerline of loading was 45 cm below the top of the walls. More details on design of these walls can be found in (Rocks, 2012).

The lateral loading protocols for SW1 and SW2 are illustrated in Figure ?6 4. It consisted of 10 load steps (LS) for SW1 and 11 load steps for SW2. The first load step had three cycles and the subsequent load steps had two cycles. The first load step was primarily applied to verify the functionality of the experiment setup and it was not included in the damage assessment results since no damage was observed. The last load step for SW2 failed to be completed because of a malfunctioning which resulted out-of-plane rotation of the wall. The loading cycles are intended to simulate the effects of earthquake shaking. The loading rate was set at around 0.6 cm/sec for SW1 and 0.13 cm/sec for SW2. More details on design of these walls can be found in (Rocks, 2012).

Axial load was not applied on these specimens because axial stresses in low aspect ratio shear walls are typically very small, as measured by a fraction of the product of Ag×fc' (in which Ag is the gross section area and f'c is the compressive strength). The force-displacement hysteresis loops and the corresponding backbone curves are illustrated in Figure ?6 5. SW1 and SW2 had a nonlinear response at LS7 and LS8, respectively, and their ultimate strengths were obtained at LS9 and LS10. After reaching the peak load in every cycle, the actuators’ load was kept constant for approximately twenty minutes to allow for cracks to be mapped and pictures to be taken. The north face of each wall was instrumented and the south face was kept clear for crack mapping, see Figure ?6 3(c). Photos were taken with an HD optic camera. Cracks were mapped manually using Adobe Photoshop Element software and the results were used as input to the proposed fractal analysis algorithm.

Experimental results
Visual inspection
This section presents the results of visual observations and crack width measurements along with identified damage grades (DGs). Considering that specimens used in this study are typically being used for nuclear safety related structures, the IAEA guidebook on non-destructive testing of concrete structures (IAEA, 2002) was used to define the DGs. According to this guideline, three DGs can be defined (i.e., I, II, and III), based on the width of cracks. In particular, if the maximum width is less than 0.2 mm, the damage is classified as grade I, between 0.2 mm and 1 mm as grade II, and above 1 mm as grade III. In general, non-structural or hairline cracks are treated as grade I, structural cracks (or medium cracks) are considered as moderate damage or grade II, and critical damage or wide cracks as grade III. No repair is needed for grade I, whereas appropriate rehabilitation strategy is necessary for grades II and III (IAEA, 2002). Residual cracks developments in each load step are illustrated in Figure ?6 6 and Figure ?6 7 for SW1 and SW2, respectively. The maximum and modal (i.e., appearing most frequently) crack widths are indicated in each picture with a square dot (?) and with a circle (?), respectively. 
Figure ?6 8 shows the maximum and modal crack width measured on the surface of the wall when it was at the peak deformation of each load step. Crack width thresholds based on the IAEA guidelines and DG boundaries are also indicated by horizontal and vertical dashed lines, respectively. It can be observed that, DG II initiates in LS2 for SW1 and LS4 for SW2. Instead the critical damage stage (III) initiates in LS7 and LS9, respectively. Considering that nonlinear mechanical behavior was observed during these load steps (see Figure ?6 5), they will be assumed as the load steps in which “critical damage” occurred.

Figure ?6 9 illustrates cracks width measured once loading was ceased and cracks were closed (i.e., residual cracks).  It can be seen that, based on residual cracks width DG II initiates in LS7 for both walls whereas DG III initiates in LS8 for SW1 and LS10 for SW2. Therefore, condition assessment based on residual cracks width would provide very inaccurate results. It should be mentioned that residual cracks width are used currently by engineers to determine the type of repair required for a damaged component (e.g., after an earthquake).

Fractal dimension results
This section presents the results of damage classification using the fractal dimension of residual cracks. At this aim, pictures were taken at the end of each load step in the south face of the wall. These pictures were imported in AutoCad, and then cracks were manually mapped, as shown in Figure ?6 10 for LS5 as an example. 
The box-counting algorithm was used to compute a fractal dimension (D) for each image. Box sizes were selected in a range between RS and RT. Then, a grid of square boxes was superimposed over each picture (Figure ?6 11a). Next the number of boxes that intersect cracks, N(r), was counted. The method was repeated with a denser and denser grid to define the number of boxes as a function of the grid spacing, r. Therefore, the estimated D was the slope of least square fit line from RS to RT in the log-log plot of N(r) versus 1/r. This procedure is illustrated in Figure ?6 11 for the SW1 at LS5.

Figure ?6 12 shows the evolution of the fractal dimension in each load step, for the two specimens SW1 and SW2. In general, the fractal dimension increases as the surface damage increases; this is consistent with the damage evolution observed for the simulated cracks in Figure ?6 2. In addition, three regions can be identified: 1) an initial region in which the fractal dimension sharply increases; 2) a plateau region in which the fractal dimension slowly changes, and 3) a third region in which the fractal dimension further increases. These observations can be explained as follow, by comparing Figure ?6 12 with the residual cracks patterns shown in Figure ?6 6 and Figure ?6 7.

 
(a)	 
(b)
Figure ?6 12 Variation of fractal dimension versus increasing load steps (RT=11cm)

In SW1, when the specimen is loaded for the first time, there is an appreciable change on the surface of the specimen caused by the formation of horizontal (flexural) and diagonal (shear) macro-cracks, as can be observed in Figure ?6 6 (i.e., LS2 to LS5). As a result, the FD increases up to a value of 1.63 between LS2 and LS5. This phase is called “region 1”. Then the FD slowly changes (by less than 0.01 increments) until LS7 in which the onset of plastic response was observed (see Figure ?6 5); this phase is characterized by no significant changes in the crack patterns (see Figure ?6 6). This region of dormancy is called “region 2”. Interestingly after this step (region 3), the FD jumps up to 1.73 (an increment of about 0.1). This increase is mostly due to the accumulation of more diagonal cracks on the middle area and horizontal cracks on the bottom area of the wall. From LS8 to LS10 few more cracks are formed; therefore small variations in the FD are observed. Similarly, in SW2, the FD sharply increases up to 1.63 in LS3 (region 1), then gradually increases until LS8 (FD=1.77) with small increments of about 0.03 (region 2). After this load step (onset of plastic response), the FD increases up to 1.87 with an increment of about 0.1 (region 3). Afterward, the FD slowly increases until failure of the specimen (LS10).
Figure ?6 13 illustrates how the selection of RT may affect the fractal dimension results. A general decrease can be observed using finer values of RT; however, the overall trend remains mostly unchanged during the loading process and the aforementioned regions can be still identified.

Damage index results
In this section the results of the proposed damage index (DI) are presented and compared with the relative stiffness loss (RSL) defined as:
 
(?6.4)where Ki is the lateral secant stiffness of the wall at the ith load step (i.e., i=1,2,…10) and K1 is the initial stiffness of the wall. Figure ?6 14 shows the results of RSL and DI versus drift ratio for both walls. Interestingly, DI can generally track the relative stiffness loss with a slight error. Therefore, DI can be exploited to infer the remnant lateral stiffness of the wall. Furthermore, it is valuable indicator of damage in cases where applied load and stiffness loss (as a sign of damage) are not available. Table 2 summarizes the walls’ stiffness, RSL, D, DI, and true DG classification (i.e., based on cracks width measured at peak displacement) for each load step. In this work two threshold levels, dj, are proposed in order to discriminate damage grades (i.e., j=1 for DG II and j=2 for DG III). In particular, a d1=0.4 is defined for DG II and d2=0.7 for the onset of DGIII.
To assess how this methodology could enhance a regular visual inspection, Figure ?6 15 summarizes the final results of damage grade identification using crack width measurement at peak deformation and at zero deformation (i.e., residual cracks) versus proposed damage index. As shown in this figure, damage grade assessment based on residual crack width has the maximum error with respect to other methods in both walls. However, DI compensates for this error significantly in both walls.  For SW1, it could extensively enhance the erroneous estimation of onset of DG II by residual cracks from LS6 to LS2 (4 load steps improvement). For SW2, it could accurately signify LS3 as the onset of DG II. Furthermore, DI could slightly improve onset of DG III in SW2.

Conclusions
It is known that RC structures are subjected to deterioration due to aging, increased load, and natural hazards. To minimize the maintenance costs and to increase the operation lifetime, researchers and practitioners are increasingly interested in improving current nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies. Conventionally, the assessment of RC structures relies on visual inspection (VI) which is time-consuming and depends heavily on the skills of the inspectors. Worldwide, various condition-rating grades have been developed to overcome the qualitative nature of VI-based condition assessment. These scales usually quantify damage conditions in terms of crack’s width. However, in the elastic regime cracks can be totally or partially closed upon load removal. Thus, width of cracks may lead to erroneous results. In this chapter a novel approach based on the fractal dimension (FD) of crack patterns was proposed to assess the structural integrity of RC structures. The approach was validated through large-scale tests on two RC shear walls subjected to lateral reversed cyclic loading. It was observed that in general the fractal dimension increases as the surface damage increases. Further, a damage index (DI) based on fractal dimension of visible residual cracks was introduced to discriminate different damage grades. It was shown that the proposed DI could be exploited to estimate the remnant lateral stiffness of the wall. The proposed index could have a role in post-disaster assessment and planning by estimating the vulnerability of buildings exposed to natural hazards (storms, earthquakes, etc.) and enabling authorities to decide whether or not a building can be safely re-occupied. More formal tests need to be carried out to verify the robustness of the approach. In addition, more specimens with different shape and size should be examined (Farhidzadeh et al., 2014b).
Even though visual inspection is the primary technique in assessment of concrete structures, hidden defects such as corrosion in reinforcing bars or pre-stressing steel strands can hardly be detected visually. The next chapter addresses corrosion diagnosis in prestressed steel strand as the main component of prestressed concrete structures and cable-stayed bridges using guided ultrasonic waves.
  

Corrosion Diagnosis Using Ultrasonic Waves

Introduction
Multiwire steel strands are widely used in civil structures such as cable-stayed bridges, prestressed concrete structures, and re-centering systems. Despite this increase in usage, the corrosion of the multiwire strands has become a concern for designers, owners and regulators. Many of these structures have suffered the failure of strands due to corrosion (Burgoyne and Scantlebury, 2008; Clark, 2013; Woodward and Williams, 1998). Extensive inspection and maintenance/repair programs have been established, with attendant direct costs and significant indirect costs due to business interruption. Evaluation of strands is technically challenging. Their general inaccessibility makes evaluation difficult, costly and often inconclusive. Several nondestructive evaluation (NDE) techniques for evaluating the condition of strands have been developed to address these issues in the past few years (Virmani, 2013). Half-Cell potential (Song and Saraswathy, 2007), time domain reflectometry (TDR) (Liu et al., 2002), linear polarization resistance (LPR) sensors (Millard et al., 2001), magnetic flux (Kishawy and Gabbar, 2010), and acoustic emission (Mangual et al., 2013) are some of the most commonly used NDE methods for corrosion diagnosis. Although these techniques have shown promise, very few if any are capable to quantify the cross-sectional loss. A technique that shows potential to quantify the extent of corrosion (e.g., cross-sectional loss) is based on guided ultrasonic waves (GUWs). As opposed to the waves used in traditional impact-echo (IE), that propagate in 3-D within the structure, GUWs propagate along the strand itself by exploiting its waveguide geometry (Beard et al., 2003). Most previous research attempted to use GUWs to detect and assess corrosion damage on reinforcing bars in reinforced concrete (RC) structures (Ervin and Reis, 2008; Ervin et al., 2009; Reis et al., 2005; Sharma and Mukherjee, 2010) and steel strands in prestressed concrete structures (Beard et al., 2003; Moustafa et al., 2014). For instance, to diagnose corrosion in reinforcing bars, energy and attenuation characteristics of longitudinal and flexural GUW modes were used (Ervin and Reis, 2008; Reis et al., 2005). Other methods based on time of flight (ToF) of the first packets were also proposed to investigate various levels of corrosion in reinforcing bars (Miller et al., 2012). Longitudinal GUWs were also used to monitor pitting and delamination in steel rebars (Sharma and Mukherjee, 2010). To monitor the corrosion process in post-tensioned concrete beams, fractal analysis of GUWs was investigated by Moustafa et al. (Moustafa et al., 2014). 
In this study, a reference-free algorithm is proposed to quantify the extent of corrosion through estimating the cross-section loss using GUW measurements. An experimental setup was designed to carry out an accelerated corrosion test on a loaded strand. The diameter of the strand’s wires was estimated using the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) (Lang and Forinash, 1998) of the GUWs. Furthermore, the uncertainty associated with estimated diameter, which originates from the Heisenberg principle in CWT (Pereyra, 2006), was quantified. In the next section, the behavior of GUW in rods and the effect of cross-section loss on dispersion curves, followed by a short introduction on CWT are presented. The details of experimental setup are then explained. The results of diameter measurement using GUW are discussed and finally the conclusion is given.
In the rest of this chapter, the chemical formulation of corrosion is briefly explained. Then the numerical modeling followed by the diameter estimation algorithm is presented. The detail of experimental study is explained, and finally, an uncertainty analysis is carried out to assess the reliability of the proposed method.

 Mechanism of corrosion
Steel is normally protected from corrosion by a thin, passive coat of hydrated iron oxide. Furthermore, the cement paste in concrete makes an alkaline environment that protects the steel from general corrosion. However, the passive film and protective alkaline environment cannot resist corrosion when the concrete reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), or chlorides penetrate in the concrete (e.g., from deicing salt or salt water). 
Corrosion is the oxidation of a metal and rust is the corrosion of iron that simply occurs in the alloy steel. Corrosion initiates through an electrochemical Oxidation-Reduction process in the presence of oxygen, water, and chlorides. Iron atoms loose electron (oxidize) via an anodic reaction and oxygen in the presence of water accept electrons (reduces) in a cathodic reaction as formulated in the following equations. 
anode (oxidation):      
(?7.1)cathode (reduction):   
(?7.1)overall:  
	(?7.2)The hydroxyl ions (OH-) combine with the ferrous ions (Fe2+) and form ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2) that has a dark greenish color. Ferrous hydroxide is further oxidized in presence of water and oxygen and converts to a brownish material called hydrated iron oxide or ferric hydroxide (Fe(OH)3). When dried, iron oxide is produced as a brownish porous solid, i.e., rust (Fe2O3):
 
(?7.3) 
(?7.4) 
(?7.5)The aforementioned processes may take years to occur. To accelerate corrosion, a steel specimen can be used in an electric circuit so that positive pole forcefully oxidizes steel through an anodic reaction. The negative pole, on the other hand, provides electrons and reduces oxygen molecules via a cathodic reaction.

NDT methods for corrosion diagnosis
During the past three decades, various condition rating techniques have been exploited to evaluate the state of corrosion in concrete structures. Although there are numerous methods to detect, diagnose, and measure corrosion in RC structures, there is no agreement on which method can assess corrosion most accurately (Song and Saraswathy, 2007). In this section, we briefly introduce each method. 

Half-Cell Potential
Figure ?7 1 illustrates the corrosion process in the reinforcing bar of a concrete element. At the anode, FE2+ are dissolved and electrons are released. These electrons move through the steel to the cathode, where they react with water and oxygen to form hydroxide (OH-). This principle generates a potential difference that can be measured by the half-cell method.
 
Figure ?7 1 Principle of steel corrosion in concrete (Proceq, 2012)
 
Figure ?7 2 Schematic representation of Half-cell potential measurement (Song and Saraswathy, 2007)

To measure the potentials at the concrete surface, a reference electrode is connected via a high-impedance voltmeter to the steel reinforcement and is moved over the concrete surface as shown in Figure ?7 2. The reference electrode could be saturated calomel electrode (SCE), copper/copper sulfate electrode (CSE), or silver/silver chloride electrode. ASTM C 876 standard (ASTM C876-91, 1999) has regulated the probability of corrosion in steel as summarized in Table ?7 1.

Table ?7 1 Corrosion condition related with half-cell potential (HCP) measurements (ASTM C876-91, 1999)
Open circuit potential (OCP) values	Corrosion condition
mV vs. SCE 	mV vs. CSE	
< -426 	< -500 	Severe corrosion
< -276 	< -350 	High (<90% risk of corrosion)
-126 to -275 	-350 to -200 	Intermediate corrosion risk
> -125	> -200 	Low(10% risk of corrosion)

Time Domain Reflectometry
Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-known method in the field of electrical engineering to detect defects in transmission lines (Liu et al., 2002). It sends an electrical pulse along the transmission line and uses an oscilloscope to observe the echoes. Any discontinuity will cause a reflection from the point of fault. From the time difference, amplitude, and polarity of the reflection, location and nature of the discontinuity is determined. The steel strands can be considered as an asymmetric, twin-conductor transmission line by applying a sensor wire along with the tendon. Hidden defects, such as pitting or general surface corrosion, change the electromagnetic properties of the medium and can be detected by TDR.
A TDR is usually configured as depicted in Figure ?7 3 (Liu et al., 2002). A pulse is generated and launched into the transmission line. An oscilloscope is hooked in the circuit to monitor the wave. The wave travels through the strand at the velocity of propagation. At any point that the wave hits a defect, a reflected wave is travel back toward the oscilloscope. The incident and reflected wave are separated in time. This time is twice the transit time from the monitoring point to the mismatch. This method resembles the ultrasonic pulse-echo method explained in Chapter 2 but in the electric field. 
 
Figure ?7 3 Configuration of Time domain reflectometry to detect deterioration in reinforcing steel (Liu et al., 2002)

Linear Polarization Resistance (LPR) 
LPR provides an estimate of the corrosion rate by measuring the polarization resistance of the sensor (Millard et al., 2001). An electronic circuit known as a Randles circuit, shown in Figure ?7 4 can simulate the corrosion interface. The resistance Rs represents the “solution resistance”, or in another word, the concrete cover resistance between the rebar and the surface. Charged ions on the surface of steel produce a double layer capacitance Cdl. Polarization resistance Rp at the surface of the steel represents how the charged iron ions can leave the metal surface and enter solution. The rate of active corrosion is inversely proportional to Rp. Figure ?7 5 shows the set up for a LRP measurement. The main advantages of the LRP sensors are smallness and flexibility that make them easily applicable between wires. Nonetheless, particular care must be taken to protect the electrodes from direct contact with metal to prevent shortening the circuit. 
 
Figure ?7 4 Randles circuit for steel bar in concrete (Millard et al., 2001)
 
Figure ?7 5 LRP measurement (Millard et al., 2001)
Coupled Multiple Array Sensors (CMAS)
CMAS’ geometry has made them a viable choice for corrosion rate monitoring. It is a cylinder with a similar diameter as a strand. So it fits perfectly inside the wire bundle. The CMAS are made of steel or zinc filaments, and each filament works as an anodic or a cathodic pole. The filaments are connected by an amphometer to measure the electric flow and calculate a non-uniform corrosion rate using Faraday’s Law.

Magnetostrictive (MS)
“Magnetostriction” is a phenomenon in ferromagnetic materials in which a magnetic field can induce small changes to the physical dimensions and vice versa. When an electric pulse is applied to a coil close to a ferromagnetic material, a transient magnetic field is applied to the component. This magnetic field generates a stress wave, traveling in both directions along the length steel bar (Rizzo and Scalea, 2005). Conversely, when the elastic pulse arrives at another coil, the magnetic field of the coil is affected and amplifies an electric voltage via the inverse MS effect. When damage exists in a medium, the elastic waves are reflected back and a complex wave interference patterns arise. The time difference and amplitude of reflection can be analyzed to assess the location and level of damage. 

Main magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL)
A flaw in a ferromagnetic object introduces a localized discontinuity in the magnetic properties. The MFL induces a magnetic field to the steel medium. As the flux propagates, it locates and records magnetic flux anomalies in the object. There are two types of these tools, high resolution MFL and standard resolution MFL. Their main difference is in the number of sensors that increases the resolution. Axially-oriented flaws such as stress corrosion cracking and selective seam corrosion are difficult to detect with MFL pigs (Kishawy and Gabbar, 2010). The MFL technique cannot be employed for continuous health monitoring and it does not provide any information on the level of stress in the strand (Bartoli et al., 2008).

Acoustic emission
Acoustic emission has been introduced since early 1990’s as a feasible corrosion detection technique in steel rebars of concrete structures (Li et al., 1998). The primary advantage AE offers over other conventional NDE methods is that it can directly identify the process of a flaw growth. When rust is produced on a corroding rebar, it swells and pressurize the surrounding concrete. This pressure nucleate microcracks and thus stress waves will be generated. The stress waves are captured by piezoelectric acoustic transducers. The signals are then analyzed based on their time of arrival and energy to realize the location and intensity of damage(Benedetti et al., 2013; Elfergani et al., 2013; Kawasaki et al., 2013, 2012; Li et al., 1998; Ohtsu and Kawasaki, 2010; Vélez et al., n.d.).

Geometry of a Strand
The strand tested in this study is composed of seven steel wires (six helical wires twisted around a straight wire. Figure ?7 6 illustrates a typical strand with geometrical annotation and Table ?7 2 summarizes geometrical and mechanical characteristics of the strand used in this study. The relationship between the pitch p and twisting radius R of the helical wire is governed by the lay angle ß as follows:
 
(?7.6)According to Machida and Durelli (Machida and Durelli, 1973), the length s of the axial line of a helical wire in a strand of length l can be expressed by: 
 
(?7.7)

where p=pitch of the helical wire=23cm and R=strand radius=5.2mm. Applying (?7.7) to the test strand, the difference in axial line length of the helical wire with respect to the central wire is as small as 0.89%. This length difference can be neglected as signals propagating in the core wire and in the helical wires are approximately detected simultaneously as shown in Figure ?7 7. The details of the strand used in this study are given in Table 7-2. Since the helical wire in this experiment is thinner than the core wire (5mm vs 5.2mm) the velocity of wave propagation in helical wire is slightly higher than the core wire (will be discussed in the next section). Therefore, in this figure, the signal from the helical wire arrives a few microseconds sooner than the core wire.
 
Figure ?7 6 Geometry of a steel strand, reprinted from (Bartoli, 2007)


 
Figure ?7 7 Signals from the core and helical wire arrive almost at the same time

When an axial load is applied to a strand, the axial force Nc in the core wire, the axial force Nh, bending moment Mh, and twisting moment Th in the helical wires developes (Machida and Durelli, 1973) (see Figure ?7 8). The ratio between the axial force in the core and helical wire is given by (Machida and Durelli, 1973):
 
(?7.8)

where Ac=21.24mm2 and Ah=19.63mm2 are the cross-sectional areas of the core and helical wires. For a lay angle of ?=7.9° in the subject strands, equation (?7.8) predicts that Nc is 10% larger than Nh.

The effects of bending and twisting moments in the helical wires can be expressed as
 
(?7.9) 
(?7.10)where sbmax is the maximum cross-sectional normal stress due to the bending moment; ttmax is the maximum cross sectional shear stress due to twisting moment; sa represents the uniform normal stress due to the axial force;  is the radius of the helical wire, and E and G are the material Young’s modulus and shear modulus, respectively. For the test strand (?7.9) and (?7.10) yield the values of sbmax / sa=1.85x10-2 and ttmax / sa=2.5x10-2, indicating that bending and twisting stresses in the helical wires can be neglected. 
According to the above equations, the strand specimen can be assumed subject to an axial load distributed uniformly over the wires cross-section and producing only a state of uniform normal stress, s, in each individual wire. 
According to Machida and Durelli (Machida and Durelli, 1973) and Figure ?7 8c, the resultant of the contact forces per unit length, P, is 
 
(?7.11)where Ph is the resultant of the contact forces between adjacent helical wires and Pc is resultant force due to contact between helical wire and core. Equilibrium of an infinitesimal element of the helical wire allows computing P as,
 
(?7.12)where the radius of curvature is
 
(?7.13)Finally, the stress distribution and contact area can be estimated according to Hertz theory. The distribution of pressure exerted between the two solids under a force per unit length P is given by:
 
(?7.14)where a is the half length of the contact arc and is evaluated using the following expression,
 
(?7.15)In this expression, l is the length of contact along the axis of the wires. The inter-wire contact and the normal stress due to axial load affect the guided wave characteristics and leakage. Nucera and Scalea (Nucera and Lanza di Scalea, 2011) modeled a 7-wire steel strand to study the effect of nonlinear inter-wire contact on the ultrasonic signals. Figure ?7 9 shows the Von Mises equivalent stress contour plots for a strand. One helical wire is excited via a 15-cycle toneburst centered at 500 kHz with an amplitude of 0.00013 psi (0.930 N/m2). It is interesting to note how the energy (stress) leaks to other wires after traveling for a short distance of about 10.2 in (26 cm).

Guided ultrasonic waves in rods
The primary benefits in using guided ultrasonic waves (GUW) for NDE and SHM purposes are: 1) long range inspection since GUW travel for long distances in waveguide, 2) complete coverage of the waveguide cross-section, and 3) increased sensitivity to small defects when compared to global vibrations (Bartoli, 2007). The complexities of guided waves due to multimodal nature as well as the dispersive characteristics are the significant drawbacks that make them complicated to work with. In order to be able to interpret guided wave propagation, an accurate knowledge of their dispersive properties, phase velocities and group/energy velocities are crucial. In this section, the theoretical background of wave propagation in a 7-wire steel strand is presented.

Waves in an Infinite Rod
To solve the problem of wave propagation in an infinite rod, it is easier to use cylindrical coordinates, where the z-axis is along the rod axis (see Figure ?7 10). The equation of motion can be expressed as follows using the Navier’s equation in cylindrical coordinates (Rose, 2004)
 
(?7.16) 
(?7.17) 
(?7.18)where ? is the dilatation in cylindrical coordinates and ?r, ??, ?z are the components of the rotation tensor as follows:
 
(?7.19) 
(?7.20) 
(?7.21) -
(?7.22)At the surface of the rod, three stress components (srr, srr, srr) must vanish (Rose, 2004). The stress-deformation relation gives,

(?7.24) 
(?7.25) 
Figure ?7 10 Cylindrical coordinates for a solid rod

Now that the foundation of equation of motion is established, we consider harmonic waves along a rod. For general case of vibration the following displacements are derived (Graff, 1991) 
 
(?7.26) 
(?7.27) 
(?7.28)where n is an integer or can be zero. Three types of vibration (i.e., longitudinal, torsional, and flexural) in a cylindrical rod are discussed as follows,
 
(?7.29)There are three types of propagating waves in a cylindrical waveguide: longitudinal, torsional, and flexural (Beard et al., 2003). Longitudinal waveforms have axial and radial displacements, torsional waveforms have angular displacements, and flexural waveforms have all three types of displacements.

Longitudinal modes in cylindrical rod
Longitudinal waves have displacement components in the radial and axial direction and are axially symmetric. Longitudinal waves corresponds to the case n=0 in (?7.26), (?7.27), and (?7.28). It is common to define the potentials ?? and ? that satisfy the wave equations (Rose, 2004):
 
(?7.30) 
(?7.31) 
(?7.32)Because of symmetry, the solution w.r.t the z-axis is,
 
(?7.33)And the displacement vector components are given by ,
 
(?7.34) 
(?7.35)and  the stress components are given by Hook’s law as
 
(?7.36) 
(?7.37)The boundary conditions constrains:
 
(?7.38)The solution of (?7.29) and (?7.30) are of the general form 
 
(?7.39) 
(?7.40)Substituting above expressions in the wave equations (?7.29), we obtain the following Bessel’s differential equation for Gj(r) (j=1,2):
 
(?7.41)whose solutions are 
G1(r)=AJ0(ar)	(?7.42)G2(r)=BJ0(ßr)	(?7.43)where a and ß are defined as,
 
(?7.44) 
(?7.45)And J0 is the Bessel function of the first kind. From (?7.39) and (?7.40),
 
(?7.46) 
(?7.47)Substituting (?7.39) and (?7.40) into (?7.34), (?7.35) yields,
 
(?7.48) 
(?7.49)where  
let C=Bß, then:
 
(?7.50) 
(?7.51)At the cylindrical surface (r=a) the stress is zero. Therefore, substituting (?7.50) and (?7.51) into (?7.36) and set it to zero for r=a, we find that
 
(?7.52)From the boundary condition srz=0 at r=a,
 
(?7.53)Finally, the requirement that the determinant of the coefficients must vanish presents us with the frequency equation as follows:
 
(?7.54)which is the Pochhammer frequency equation for the longitudinal modes. For each kn root of (?7.54), from (?7.53) we find,
 
(?7.55)
Torsional waves
For torsional waves, the equation of motion is (Graff, 1991)
 
(?7.56)Applying the harmonic wave form and algebraic manipulation to solve the differential equation, yields,
 
(?7.57)where B is arbitrary. For more details see (Graff, 1991) and (Rose, 2004). 



Flexural waves
As said earlier, the flexural mode has all three types of vibration (longitudinal, torsional, and flexural). In this mode, the family defined by n=1 in (?7.26), (?7.27), and (?7.28) is the most important. Without going into details of the solution, the final form is,
 
(?7.58) 
(?7.59) 
(?7.60)
Dispersion curves
Dispersion curves exhibit the relation between the velocity and frequency of wave modes. They are indeed obtained by numerical solution of the equations of motion for various vibration modes. 
In this study, a 15.2mm Grade 270 steel tendon consisting of six 5.0mm diameter wires spirally wrapped around a central 5.2mm diameter wire is considered (see Table ?7 2 for details). Beard et al (Beard et al., 2003) observed the guided waves in individual wires of a strand behave similar to single wires with minor discrepancies associated to inter-wire contact. Therefore, in this study, the wires are treated as such in both the modeling and the experimental test presented. Figure ?7 11 displays the dispersion curves for a 5 mm steel bar in the frequency range between 0-1000kHz; The modes are labeled by the notation L(m,n), T(m,n), and F(m,n). The characters “m” and “n” represent the circumferential displacement (function of cos(m?)) and the sequential order of the mode, respectively.
 Figure ?7 12, Figure ?7 13, Figure ?7 14 show higher modes up to 7.5MHz for longitudinal, torsional, and flexural modes, respectively. As frequency moves to infinity the lowest longitudinal mode approaches the velocity of Rayleigh waves (2860 m/sec) and the velocity of higher modes approach cT (3100 m/sec). Longitudinal waves in rods are less attenuative (i.e., can travel a long distance) and thus are typically used for inspection of steel strands (Beard et al., 2003; Lanza et al., 2003; Nucera and Lanza di Scalea, 2011; Salamone et al., 2011b). Attenuation coefficient for flexural modes are high (Shull and Dekker, 2002) and dissipate fast after traveling a short distance. Furthermore, as shown in Figure ?7 13b, higher flexural modes exhibit a very complicated behavior. Torsional waves are not of interest in this study as well because capturing these modes needs a number of sensors attached around the wire at a certain location; given the size of commercially available sensors, this is literally impractical.

To study the wavelength of the propagating waves, Figure ?7 15 depicts the relationship between wave number and frequency for the first three longitudinal modes up to the range of 1 MHz. For the first longitudinal mode, which is the predominant mode of vibration, the wavenumber is close to 600 [1/m] (i.e., ?=1.7mm) at around the frequency of 440 kHz. To be able to capture this wavelength, very small piezoelectric sensors should be used. Characteristics of the sensors used in this study are discussed in the section of experimental studies.
 
Figure ?7 15 Frequency versus wave number curves for longitudinal modes of a 5.2mm diameter steel bar
To simulate the first longitudinal waveform in an individual wire of a strand, a sinusoidal function with 3.5 cycles and central frequency=400kHz enveloped with a Hanning window was numerically modeled to be applied to the piezoelectric transducer attached on the cross-section of the rod. Using the PCdisp software (Granja, 2011), the modeled waveforms at a distance equal to 1.23m was analyzed (see Figure ?7 16). The wave arrives the other side of the rod after 245µsec. The long tail of the waveform belongs to the higher frequency components of L(0,1) that is evidenced by complex wavelet transformed shown in Figure ?7 17. Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is explained in the next section. 
To observe how the mode and frequency of vibration affects the deformation within the rod’s cross section, Figure ?7 18 illustrate the modal displacement for 1st to 5th longitudinal modes at the frequency of peak velocity (except L(0,1) which is shown at 300kHz). At lower modes and frequencies, the axial deformation uz is quite uniform along the radius. At L(0,2) and 1000kHz, the maximum displacement occurs at the surface of the rod, making it susceptible to variations on surface boundary condition. At higher modes and frequencies, the contribution of surface displacement reduces. For instance, Figure ?7 18e show negligible surface displacement at the frequency of 2700kHz for L(0,5). 
In the rest of this chapter, it will be shown how the aforementioned theories can be used for corrosion diagnosis in steel strands, starting with description of the experimental setup.

Effect of corrosion on GUWs
Corrosion is usually an electrochemical oxidation-reduction process that converts the major component of steel, iron (Fe), to ferrous hydroxide (Fe(OH)2). A consequence of this process is the reduction in member cross sectional area, which eventually affects its structural performance. To simulate the effect of corrosion and investigate how the reduction in a rod’s cross sectional area affects the guided wave propagation, the dispersion curves for the first longitudinal mode L(0,1), were generated for various diameters, ranging from 5mm to 2.5mm. The results are shown in Figure ?7 19. It can be observed that in a frequency range between 0-600kHz the group velocity increases as the cross-sectional area decreases. Moreover, certain frequencies (e.g., 500kHz) provide a larger sensitivity to diameter changes than other frequencies (e.g., 300kHz). 

 
Figure ?7 19 Dispersion curves for the first longitudinal mode L(0,1) in steel rods with various diameters

Figure ?7 20 shows the group velocity of the L(0,1) mode as a function of the frequency-diameter product (i.e., v=F(fd)). Therefore, the inverse problem, which is to calculate the diameter given the dispersion curves, can be solved by measuring the velocity of a certain frequency component in the signal.  In order to limit the effects of the high order modes the excitation frequency was selected in a frequency range below the first cut-off frequency. In this work, a time-frequency analysis (continuous wavelet transform) was used to measure the group velocity of the L(0,1) mode.

Continuous wavelet transform
Continuous wavelet transform (CWT) for analyzing non-stationary signals has received significant interest in the last few years, due to its ability to extract signal time and frequency information simultaneously (Lang and Forinash, 1998). The CWT of a time domain signal f(t) is given by,
 
(?7.61)where ?*(t) denotes the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet ?(t), s is the dilation parameter (scale), and b is the translation parameter (location). In this study, a complex Morlet was used as mother wavelet (Addison, 2002), defined as:
 
(?7.62)where fb is the bandwidth parameter and fc is the wavelet center frequency. The energy density of a signal is represented by the Power Spectral Density (PSD) as,
 
(?7.63)where,
 
(2.6)
The methods based on wavelet transform have an inherent source of uncertainty that originates from the Heisenberg principle (Pereyra, 2006). Based on this principle, the resolution in time and frequency domains is limited according to the following relationship (Pereyra, 2006):
 
(?7.64)where  and   are time and frequency variances, respectively. These quantities represent the local resolution of CWT. For a given signal with sampling frequency fs , the complex Morlet transform yields the following equations for  and  (Pereyra, 2006):
 
(?7.65) 
(?7.66)in which the dilation parameter (i.e., s) is inversely proportional to the local frequency  according to the following equation:
 
(?7.67)
Experimental setup
An experimental setup was designed to validate the proposed approach. Specifically, a loading apparatus was designed and built to apply a tensile load to a seven-wire strand. Then, accelerated corrosion tests were carried out on the axially loaded strand.

Strand characteristics
In this study, a 15.2mm Grade 270 steel tendon consisting of six 5.0mm diameter wires spirally wrapped around a central 5.2mm diameter wire was considered (see Table ?7 2 for details). The length of each helical wire was assumed equal to the length of the central wire since the lay angle ß was very small (the difference was as small as 0.89%) (Bartoli, 2007; Farhidzadeh, 2014). In addition, considering that the pitch length (230mm) was much longer than the typical wavelength in the signals (smaller than 10 mm (Farhidzadeh, 2014)), each wire was treated as an individual rod (Beard et al., 2003). Beard et al (Beard et al., 2003) observed that guided waves in individual wires of a strand behave similar to single wires with minor discrepancies associated to inter-wire contact.

 Loading Device
Drawings of the loading apparatus are shown in Figure ?7 21. It consists of two I-shape rigid beams (web: 76.2cm×7.6cm×1.9cm (30"×3"×3/4"), flanges: 50.8cm×1.3cm (20" ×4"×1/2")) connected with two   all thread steel bars. In the middle of each beam’s web, a 5/8" hole was drilled; the strand passed through the holes and was fixed using wedge anchorages. The load was applied by tightening the nuts, which pushes the rigid beams and stretches the strand; a large wrench with handle extension was used for this purpose. Therefore, the all thread bars are under compressive force. To prevent bucking, two wood beams were connected to the bars using u-shaped hooks (see Figure ?7 22). Two hollow load cells passed through the all thread bars and were located between the beam’s web and the nuts’ washers. The tensile load on the strands was continuously measured during the corrosion test as the summation of readings from these two load cells. The strand was initially loaded up to 89 kN (=20 kips ~ 40% of yielding force) which was the designed capacity of the loading apparatus.

 Description of test set-up
The experimental setup for corrosion was designed to investigate various NDE techniques. Ultrasonic, acoustic emission, infrared thermography, and visual inspection were used to investigate the feasibility of each method in representing ongoing corrosion. Figure ?7 23 shows an overview of the experimental setup with annotated equipment and a list of elements. National Instrument PXI and LabVIEW were used to excite and receive guided ultrasonic waves. An Olympus square pulser Model 5077PR was used for pulse-echo configuration as well as to excite higher modes using high frequency sensors. A Micro II Physical Acoustic Corporation system was utilized to record acoustic emission activities during corrosion process. An infrared camera was mounted on top of the strand to carry out an active infrared thermography test at each stage of corrosion. To record the whole duration of corrosion, a video camera with recording rate of 1 frame per 2 minutes was used. In this dissertation, the result of ultrasonic method is reported.
 
Figure ?7 23 Experimental setup 

 Ultrasonic instruments
Ultrasonic tests were performed using broadband piezoelectric transducers in a through-transmission (i.e., pitch-catch) configuration. A schematic drawing of the experimental setup is shown in Figure ?7 24. Two through-transmission setup were used to investigate the low frequency modes (below the first cut-off frequency), and the higher frequency modes (above the first cut-off frequency). For the low frequency modes the measurement equipment used for signal generation and data acquisition was mainly constituted by a National Instruments (NI), modular PXI 1042 unit. The unit included an arbitrary waveform generator card (PXI 5412) and one, 20GS/s 12-bit multi-channel digitizers (PXI 5105). A high voltage amplifier was used to amplify the excitation to the ultrasonic transmitters, while a preamplifier (Olympus 5660C) was used to amplify the ultrasonic receivers. Four ultra-mini broadband transducers (Physical Acoustic Corporation PICO), which are sensitive in a frequency range between 200 kHz and 700 kHz, were used to generate and receive ultrasonic waves (sensors S1, S2, S3, and S4 in Figure ?7 25a). In addition, four PZT transducers were attached to a peripheral wire as shown in Figure ?7 25b. LabVIEW software was used to control the sensors, and acquire the data. 
For the high frequency modes a commercial pulser-receiver (Olympus 5077PR) was used to drive two piezoelectric transducers with a central frequency of 5MHz (Olympus V1091) with a square wave pulse of selectable width (sensors S6 and S7 in Figure ?7 25a). The received signals were recorded using an oscilloscope (Lecroy Wave Runner 44Xi-A).
In both experimental setups, transducers were carefully mounted as perpendicular to the wire’s cross section as possible to measure the longitudinal wave motions. The diameter of the transducers was about the same as the diameter of the single wire so that there was no contact between the transducers and the adjacent wires, as shown in Figure ?7 26.

Ultrasonic test results
This section presents the results of ultrasonic tests. It includes effect of loading on GUWs, visual inspection of corrosion, monitoring load and mass loss during corrosion, excitation toneburst, attenuation, and a velocity-based method to estimate cross-section loss. 
Validating numerical modeling
To validate the numerical modeling of longitudinal modes, a square toneburst with 5MHz central frequency was generated and send to the 5MHz sensor (S6). Figure ?7 27a shows the received signal from the other 5MHz sensor (S7) and Figure ?7 27b exhibits its wavelet transform. The first ten longitudinal modes are annotated on the wavelet result. The white solid line shows the dispersion curves that conform very well to the experimental result. In the reflection, the mode numbers 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are not completely attenuated even after traveling for 3 times along the strand.

Effect of loading
The tendon was clamped by the anchorages and loaded incrementally to 5 kips (22.24 kN), 10 kips (44.48 kN), 15 kips (66.72kN), and 20 kips (89kN) which is 50% of the yield force.
To investigate the effect of anchorage on the GUWs, a pulse-echo configuration using S6 was set up. At each load step, a square toneburst with 5MHz central frequency was generated and the reflections were recorded. Figure ?7 28 shows the results. The first packet belongs to reflection from the anchorage and the second packet is the back wall echo (BWE) from the other end. The BWE attenuates upon increased tension. The reason is twofold: 1) a significant portion of the signal is reflected and absorbed by the anchorage through the jagged wedges, 2) since the anchorage clamps the strand and enhanced the inter-wire surface contact, the signal energy leaks more to the other wires. 
 
Figure ?7 28 Signals for various loading steps by pulse-echo configuration

Wavelet transform was applied on these signals to understand how the anchorage affects the longitudinal modes. The anchorage reflections in Figure ?7 29 shows high a portion of energy is reflected in high frequency range (between 1.5 MHz to 5.5MHz) and another portion in low frequencies (between 0 to 0.4MHz). Similarly, the BWE do not encompass second and first modes. The third mode is very weak as well. To explore the physical reason, one should refer to the modal vibration at the cross section of wires shown in Figure ?7 18. It is interesting to note that at L(0,1), the cross-section deformation is quite uniform and at L(0,2) the displacement occurs mainly at the surface of the wire. On the other hand, in L(0,5), the displacement is within the wire. Therefore, at lower modes, the energy of the signal can leak from the surface to the anchorage or other wires while for higher modes the energy is preserved within the wire.
Upon increasing the load from 0 to 5 kips, the 3rd mode disappeared as well. At this mode, a portion of displacement is on the surface, making it susceptible to variation in surface contact with increasing load. The other modes become weaker compared to zero load as the inter-wire energy leakage increases.

Figure ?7 29 Wavelet analysis of the signals for in loading steps by pulse-echo configuration

The amplitude of the signal packets echoed from anchorage and BWE are plotted in Figure ?7 30. The amplitude of anchorage reflection exceeds the BWE at load step 3 (10kips). It should be noted that in a pulse-echo configuration, the received BWH signal has passed through the anchorages for four times collectively (two in the departure and two in the return). Therefore, the lower modes (that a considerable portion of displacement is on the surface) are subjected to sever attenuation. Therefore, a pitch-catch configuration was also studied to reduce the number of anchorage crossing to two. Figure ?7 31 shows the results of CWT on the received waveform. It is interesting to see that the lower modes could survive in this configuration. However, the 2nd mode at around 1000 kHz fades out upon loading.

We now want to understand the behavior of GUW and the frequency response of the waveforms upon loading using PICO and PZT transducers. Figure ?7 32 shows the root mean square (RMS) of the signals traveled in one helical wire (received at S4 as a result of excitation at S2). Increasing the tensile load on a strand enhances the surface contact between the wires, causing more energy leakage from one wire to the others. Therefore, the portion of energy for the same wire reduces. The waveforms for the maximum RMS are show in Figure ?7 33.
     
Figure ?7 31 Wavelet analysis of signals from the 5MHz pulse, pitch-catch configuration
 
Figure ?7 32 RMS of the signals at 3.5 cycles
 
Figure ?7 33 GUW signals at peak RMS
Another important parameter that slightly changed upon loading was the velocity of the waveform. Figure ?7 34 shows the velocity of the wave using threshold crossing technique versus frequency of excitation at different loading steps. It is found that between 400 kHz and 700 kHz, the velocity of the wave propagation reduces by increasing the axial load. This variation ranges between 200m/sec at 300 kHz to 600m/sec at 400 kHz. It should be noted that the method of threshold crossing has an inherent error because it depends on the amplitude/energy of the signal. Therefore, the reduction in amplitude can cause erroneous detection of first arrival. Another error comes from disregarding elongation of strand due to axial load. The initial length is divided by time of arrival and this results in reduction in apparent velocity as time of flight increases. The reason for disregarding the strain is that in a real situation, we have no information about the current load and strain to account for them.
 
Figure ?7 34 Velocity change upon loading

The PZT transducers could also reveal interesting information about the load status. Two transducers were deployed before and after the left anchorage (PZT1 and PZT2). The signal generated from PZT1 and received by PZT2 to investigate the effect of anchorage upon loading. The sweep frequency test and the RMS of waveforms, plotted in Figure ?7 35a, shows the anchorage attenuates the lower frequency signals (e.g. 200 kHz) more than the higher frequency signals. 
To study the effect of inter-wire contact upon loading, PZT2 was used as the actuator and PZT3 as the receiver. Therefore, there is no anchorage in the path. The results are given in Figure ?7 35b. It is interesting to note that the higher frequency signals attenuate faster through inter-wire contact.

Corrosion progress, load drop, and mass loss
Faraday’s law was used to predict the strand mass loss. Faraday’s law provides a relationship between the time of an applied current and the amount of steel weight loss according to the following equation: 
 
(?7.68)where m is the mass in grams, A is the atomic mass of iron (56g), Z is the valence of the reacting electrode (2 for iron), F is the Faraday’s constant (96,500 A.sec), t is time in seconds, and I(t) is the current in ampere. Therefore the theoretical percentage of mass loss, ?m, was calculated as:
 
(?7.69)where M is the total mass of the strand. Figure ?7 36 shows the measured results based on gravimetric mass loss and the corresponding theoretical mass loss based on Faraday’s law. Faraday’s law predicted well the degrees of corrosion (mass loss) with the impressed current technique. 
 
Figure ?7 36 Mass loss versus time during accelerated corrosion test

It should be noted that the measured mass loss was rust (i.e., Fe2O3). Therefore, given the atomic mass of oxygen (16g), a correction coefficient of 0.7 (i.e., (2×56) / (2×56+3×16)) was applied on the mass measurements to take into account the iron portion of the rust. Figure ?7 37 shows the strand axial load measurements through the load cells during the accelerated corrosion test. The failure of three wires was recorded at day 21st. It is noteworthy that load drop after the failure of the 2nd and 3rd wire was almost twice the load drop after the 1st wire breakage. Therefore the load was equally distributed on each wire. The influence of the impressed current on the load drop rate can be observed at the 18th day, when impressed current was increased from 0.5A to 1.5A.
 
Figure ?7 37 Load versus time during accelerated corrosion test

Figure ?7 38 illustrates the strand condition at different levels of corrosion. The measured mass loss is also reported for each level of corrosion. The location of the wire breakage is indicated with arrows. 
 
Figure ?7 38 Corrosion process in a steel strand
The pattern of corrosion was also compared with a corroded strand without applied load during accelerated corrosion. The patterns are shown in Figure ?7 39. In the loaded strand, there are parallel cracking on the surface while in the free strand corrosion is more like dints on the surface. The corroded layer cannot sustain tension, cracks and scales off.

Number of cycles in excitation tone burst
This section addresses the effect of number of excitation cycles on the results. For transmission-through configuration, the actuator transducers were driven by toneburst functions, sinusoidal with Hanning window and various number of cycles (i.e., 3.5, 10.5, 20.5, 50.5). The central frequencies are given in Table ?7 3 for each sensor and cycle. The gain for the received signals was set at 40dB. The signals were recorded for 1250 µsec at the sampling frequency of 20MHz. The excitation functions at 440 kHz are illustrated in Figure ?7 40.

The frequency response spectra (at pristine state) using PZT transducers are demonstrated in Figure ?7 41 for excitation (target) frequencies of 300, 500, 700, and 900 kHz. Using a higher number of cycles injects more energy for exciting the target frequency and confines the frequency response to that of excitation. Therefore, narrowband frequency response is observed for higher cycles (e.g., 50) in Figure ?7 41. On the other hand, small number of cycles (e.g., 3.5), make the toneburst resemble a pulse function that excite a wider range of frequencies. Figure ?7 41c and d show a higher number of cycles is needed to receive the target frequency response. The same pattern was observed using PICO sensors.

Figure ?7 42a-d shows the amplitude of signals using PICO sensors at the central wire during accelerated corrosion test for different number of cycles. The amplitude of the signals reduced rapidly after 5% mass loss. In addition, from Figure ?7 42b-d it can be implied that the signals attenuate very fast when a large number of cycles is used for exciting higher frequencies.

Attenuation
Attenuation coefficients were calculated using the following equation: 
 
(?7.70)where ?i is the attenuation coefficient in dB/m, L is the length of strand, A0 is the amplitude of the signal at pristine state, and Ai is the amplitude at ith day. Two PICO sensors in a through-transmission configuration were used to generate and receive GUWs on a peripheral helical wire and two others on the central wire. Figure ?7 43 shows the result for helical and central wire. The attenuation coefficient increased to 30 dB/m for helical wire and 35 dB/m for central wire. It is interesting to see this parameter is quite constant for all frequencies at each corrosion state (mass loss).

To investigate the attenuation of the higher longitudinal modes during the corrosion process, two piezoelectric broadband transducers with a central frequency of 5 MHz were used in a through-transmission-configuration, as described in section 3.4. Figure ?7 44 shows the CWT of the received signals in day 1, 3, 4, and 5. For the first day, the CWT was estimated and compared with numerical results of dispersion curves obtained from the PCdisp toolbox. There is a clear correspondence between theory (solid lines) and experimental results (CWT). After five days (less than 3% mass loss) only the L(0,1) mode was left.

Reference-free diameter estimation
Excitation Frequency 
Two criteria were used for the selection of excitation frequency. First, the frequency should yield high sensitivity to diameter change. Second, it has to ensure that the ultrasound has enough energy to travel the desired distance. To satisfy the first criterion, the optimum frequency is defined when the derivative of velocity with respect to fd (i.e.,  ) is maximum. This yields fd~2500 kHz-mm (i.e., f=500kHz for d=5mm), which is the solution of  . For the energy criterion, a sweep frequency test is often carried out experimentally to realize at which excitation frequency the root mean square (RMS) of the signal is larger. To satisfy these two criteria simultaneously, a sweep frequency test should be done in a frequency range at which   is reasonably large. A reasonable frequency range is defined when   meaning a unit change in fd causes more than a unit change in velocity. Figure ?7 45 shows the derivative of velocity and the recommended range for the sweep frequency test represented by the shaded area. 
 
Figure ?7 45 Derivative of the velocity with respect to frequency ? diameter for a steel rod

A 3.5-cycle, Hanning-modulated toneburst was used as the actuating signal. For the selection of the excitation frequency a swept of frequencies were performed between 300 kHz and 700 kHz. The dominant L(0,1) mode was received and analyzed. Figure ?7 46 shows the signal strengths (RMS) during the corrosion test. The highest RMS was obtained at 440 kHz. Therefore, the frequency of 440 kHz was selected as excitation frequency. Figure ?7 47 shows the time waveforms for days 3, 6, 10, and 18. It is observed that the first arrival packets do not change considerably in time as they correspond to the lower frequency components of L(0,1).

Figure ?7 47 Ultrasonic signals at different corrosion states; the velocity does not change considerably for the first arrivals (bottom left) while it clearly changes at the high energy part of the signal (bottom right)

The typical received signal and corresponding CWT of the signal before the corrosion test (i.e., pristine condition) is shown in Figure ?7 48. CWT was compared with numerical results of dispersion curves. There is a clear correspondence between theory (dashed line) and experimental results (CWT map), which indicate that the first longitudinal mode is the predominant mode of displacement in the received signal. To visualize the Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle discussed earlier, the time and frequency standard deviations (i.e.,   and   in equations (7.65) and (7.66)) are also indicated on the Heisenberg box (Pereyra, 2006). To estimate the wire diameter at the pristine state (i.e., 5mm), the maximum value of CWT, called the peak ridge, was identified. The projection of the peak ridge on frequency and time axes corresponds to the dominant frequency   and time-of-flight (ToF)  , respectively. At the pristine state, the peak ridge was at  =357 ?sec and  =470 kHz. Given the strand length of 1.23 m, the velocity of 3440 m/sec was calculated. Therefore, the dispersion curves shown in Figure ?7 20 were used to estimate the diameter (i.e., 5.002mm). There is a clear correspondence between the actual value (5mm) and the estimated value (5.002mm).
This procedure was repeated every day to estimate the average cross-section loss during the corrosion process. To take into account the fact that, the experimental setup was designed to corrode just a portion of strand, some modifications were needed to find the average velocity in the corroded part. At this aims the strand was divided in three regions: 1) left end side of the salt water tank with length l1, 2) inside the salt water tank with length l2, 3) right end side of the salt water tank with length l3. The middle part (i.e., inside the salt water tank) was the corroding part of the strand, while the other two regions with length l1 and l3 remained pristine during the test. Therefore the arrival time   was estimated as:

(?7.71)where   is the ToF at each region, and  l1, l2, and l3, are constant (i.e., l1=l3=31cm, l2=61cm). The wave velocity   considered for the pristine parts was obtained from the dispersion curves at d=5mm. Since the corrosion was not perfectly uniform, we estimated an average velocity   in the middle part of the strand as:
 
(?7.72)Having the velocity   and frequency , the average diameter of a wire in the corroding part was estimated from the L(0,1) mode dispersion curve in Figure ?7 20. This procedure was repeated at different stages of corrosion and the results are presented in Figure ?7 49. This figure shows a reasonable correspondence between the estimated and measured diameter. The larger error (10%) was recorded at the 20th day.

Uncertainty quantification
The most critical challenge here is to provide a quantitative assessment of how closely our estimates (i.e., diamater) reflect reality in the presence of measurement uncertainty. In general, uncertainties can be caused by random and systematic errors. The random errors are caused by unknown and unpredictable changes in measurements (e.g., ToF), including instrumentation noise, temperature changes, etc. (Dehghan Niri et al., 2013). Systematic errors are mostly caused by the digital signal processing technique (e.g., CWT) used for analyzing the time waveforms (Dehghan Niri et al., 2013). This section aims at quantifying the systematic uncertainty, caused by the time-frequenecy analysis (i.e., CWT), which arises from the Heisenberg principle, as described in section 2.3. Thus, both ToF (t) and frequency (f) were treated as Gaussian random variables with variance   and   defined according to equations (7.65) and (7.66), respectively. Also the group velocity (v) was treated as a Gaussian random variable with mean   and variance   defined as (see Appendix):
 
 
(?7.73)The two random variables f and v are related by the Pochhammer-Chree equation   (i.e., dispersion curves). Therefore, given the pdf of f and v, the systematic uncertainty associated to the estimated diameter was evaluated by determining its pdf. Several techniques exist in the literature to approximate the pdf of random variables (Kumar et al., 2009), including Monte Carlo (MC) methods (Kroese et al., 2011), Unscented Transformation (UT) (Julier and Uhlmann, 2004), and Delta method (Casella and Berger, 2002). Monte Carlo method, which is the most popular, require extensive computational resources and effort, and become increasingly infeasible for portable NDT devices with small processing units. The UT and Delta method, are both used to estimate the statistics of a random variable which undergoes a nonlinear transformation as in  (Julier and Uhlmann, 2004). In the UT method, instead of randomly selecting multiple data points from a pdf, a few data points (called sigma points) are intelligently selected. The Delta method is motivated by the assumption that in this study the dispersion curve can be approximated by a linear function in the interested velocity range. More details on the application of these techniques (MC, UT and Delta method) are provided in Appendix. 
Figure ?7 50 illustrates the application of the aforementioned methods for uncertainty propagation analysis. It focuses the dispersion curve (shown by dashed-dot line) at the velocity mean . The velocity pdf is shown by a thick solid line. The sampled points from the velocity pdf are shown by narrow gray lines, representing the MC simulation. These points are projected to fd axis through the dispersion curve (i.e.,  ). The UT sigma points are also superimposed using three red dotted lines, signifying the significant reduction in required sampling points. The Delta method is represented by a dashed tangent line on the dispersion curve at .  These methods yield the pdf for product of frequency and diameter (i.e.,  ~ ) that is shown by a black narrow line. Given the parameters of fd pdf, the diameter’s mean and variance are calculated via the following equations:

Figure ?7 50 Heisenberg uncertainty propagation through the nonlinear dispersion function of L(0,1) analyzed by Monter Carlo (MC), Unscented Transform (UT) and Delta methods
Figure ?7 51 shows the estimated pdf of diameter using the aforementioned methods at the 10th day as an example. The histogram and pdf obtained using MC method are shown by vertical bars and a dashed line. The solid line represents the pdf of the diameter using UT, and the dotted line is that of delta method. There is a clear correspondence between the pdf obtained with all three methods. However, UT and Delta method provides significant computational cost reduction compared to Monte Carlo method.
Finally Figure ?7 52 illustrates the estimated diameter’s mean and standard deviation as well as the measured diameter during the corrosion test. It is remarkable to note that the difference between measured and estimated diameter is always less than one standard deviation. The standard deviations are approximately 0.7 ? 0.1 mm. The total diameter reduction is less than 1.5mm and this evidence the high resolution of the proposed velocity-based approach to estimate the diameter.

Table ?7 4 presents the statistics of diameter at every inspection day for every method. At each day, the methods of MC, UT, and Delta yield almost identical values for diameter and standard deviation. The standard deviation does not vary considerably and reduces slightly during the experiment, ranging from 0.69 at pristine state to 0.63 at critical corrosion. The error  in estimation of diameter is defined as,
 
(?7.75)where  is the measured diameter. The error at each inspection period is less than 10%. It increased at the final stages of corrosion when cross section loss reached to a critical state (see error in days 18 and 20 in Table ?7 4).

Conclusions
This study aims at designing a reference-free nondestructive evaluation technique for corrosion damage estimation in loaded 7-wire steel strands using guided ultrasonic waves. A small-scale experiment was designed to investigate corrosion process and behavior of ultrasonic waves in prestressed steel strands under accelerated corrosion. Load and mass loss were measured during the test. Attenuation coefficients were monitored and reached to 35 dB at critical state of corrosion. A new method based on the velocity of certain velocity components was proposed and validated to estimate the cross section loss. Continuous wavelet transform was used to localize the highest energy content in time-frequency domain. Having the frequency and ToF (that yields the velocity), the diameter was estimated using the numerically derived dispersion function for the first longitudinal mode. This function correlates velocity to multiplication of frequency and diameter. In addition, an uncertainty analysis was carried out to study propagation of time and frequency uncertainties from Heisenberg principle to the diameter calculation. The proposed algorithm does not need a baseline as a reference and directly measure the diameter via through-transmission configuration in ultrasonic testing. The algorithm was validated experimentally and the results conformed very well to the diameter measurements during visual inspection.
 

Post-Earthquake Evaluation of Pipelines Using Acoustic Emission

Introduction
The U.S. water distribution network is aging and many underground pipelines in this infrastructure are beginning to leak or fail altogether. Several studies estimate that water leakage costs the nation $1-2 billion annually. More importantly, this estimate does not consider the ancillary costs to the economy, such as property damage and replacement costs due to infrastructural failures (“Aging Water Infrastructure Research Program,” 2013, “Water Resource Adaptation Program (WRAP),” 2012; Yang et al., 2009). Leakage is not just an economical issue as it is often perceived and presented by water utilities but it is also an environmental and potentially safety issue as well. In fact, leakages cause energy distribution loss throughout the network and thus cause wasting energy used for pumping the water (Colombo and Karney, 2002). In addition, it may degrade water quality by infection infiltration into the water supply in low pressure conditions (NRC, 2005). To increase the operational lifetime of existing underground pipelines without laborious and costly excavation, replacement, and embankment, in-situ trenchless pipeline lining technology has received significant interest over the past three decades (Allouche et al., 2011). The concept is to install prefabricated flexible polymeric liners inside existing pipelines. The linings ensure continuity of flow, prevent leakage and intrusion, and provide variable degrees of structural strengthening. The cured in-place pipeline (CIPP) has been a growing subset of trenchless pipeline lining technologies since its beginning in 1971 and is now a substantial market for rehabilitating existing utilities. CIPP typically consists of a resin-impregnated wad or fiber sleeve (Dawson, 2012). Due to flexibility of uncured resin, the sleeve can crawl into a damaged pipeline. When they fit in place, the sleeves are inflated until they attach firmly to the interior face of the existing pipeline, and then they are cured in that position (Dawson, 2012). Since the liners are typically made from thermosetting materials, they can be cured by hot steam or water. Figure ?8 1 shows a typical section of a pipeline retrofitted with Insituform IMain liner, one commercial type of CIPP liner manufactured by InsituForm Technologies, LLC, Chesterfield, Missouri, USA (“InsituForm Technologies, LLC. Cured in Place Pipe,” 2008).

Despite the significant progression and industrialization of CIPP, there is a lack of verification of in-situ pipeline lining technologies for the seismic retrofit of underground pipelines. This chapter presents the results of an experimental study aimed at monitoring the performance and degradation of full scale pipe-lining systems, subjected to static and dynamic loading, using acoustic emission (AE) technique. Particularly, two damage mechanisms are investigated: (1) delamination between the pipeline and the liner, and (2) incipient failure of the liner. A statistical pattern recognition technique based on a multivariate outlier analysis is presented for automatically identifying the onset of critical damage. Such a system could inform decision makers about the need for repair to ensure the safe and reliable operation of underground infrastructure. 
These research findings are presented in six sections. In the next section, a brief overview of AE technique is presented, and then followed by a description of the outlier analysis. The remaining sections discuss the experimental study, including the experimental setup and loading protocols, and   the experimental results. Finally, the main conclusions of the study are presented.

Acoustic emission technique
Acoustic Emission (AE) can be defined as a transient elastic wave generated by the rapid release of energy from a localized source (or sources) within a specific material (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). This energy propagates as a stress wave in the structure and is detected by one or more AE sensors. Generally some relevant features are extracted from AE waveforms to perform the critical tasks of damage localization, and damage characterization. Extracting features from an AE waveform is usually referred to as a parameter-based AE technique. Figure ?8 2 illustrates a typical AE signal with some of the most common features, such as peak amplitude, duration and count. 
 
Figure ?8 2 AE waveform with time-driven features
A threshold is set somewhat above the background noise level to serve as a reference for the waveform features. The moment of threshold crossing is the onset of signal. The AE peak amplitude is defined as the maximum amplitude of the signal. The number of times the signal rises and crosses the threshold is the count of the AE signal. The duration is the time period between the rising edge of the first count and the falling edge of the last count. Rise time is the time between the onset and peak amplitude. For a complete list of AE features commonly used in practice, the reader can refer to (Cooperation, 2005). One of the key advantages of AE over other nondestructive test methods, is its ability to locate defects that are active in the structure (e.g., leak, corrosion, impact, etc.) (Dehghan Niri et al., 2013). Traditionally, AE source localization is performed using time-of-flight (TOF) measurements taken at multiple receiving points (similar to what is done in seismology, when locating the epicenter of an event from an array of monitoring stations). 
The ability of AE technique to identify defects in pipelines, including leaks, cracks, and corrosion, has been demonstrated in several works (Ai et al., 2010; Bernasconi et al., 2012; Davoodi and Mostafapour, 2012; de la Rosa et al., 2007; Elfergani et al., 2013; Giunta et al., 2012, 2011; Jiao et al., 2004; Juliano et al., 2012; Kahirdeh et al., 2013; Khulief et al., 2012; Kishawy and Gabbar, 2010; Leemans, 1980; Li et al., 2012; Lim and Kaewkongka, 2007; Liu et al., 2012; Merson and Chernyaeva, 2007; Mil’man et al., 2012; Miller et al., 1999; Min et al., 2012; Mostafapour and Davoudi, 2013; Ozevin and Harding, 2012; Pour-Ghaz et al., 2011; Ramirez, 2012; Shehadeh et al., 2006; Travers, 1997). However, its application to monitor the damage progression in pipe-liner systems subjected to seismic loading has been modest, if any.


Outlier analysis
To understand whether the condition of the structure has deviated significantly from its normal operational condition, e.g., incipient failure of the liner, a statistical approach based on outlier analysis is presented in this chapter. Outlier analysis has been extensively used in the structural health monitoring (SHM) community (Bouziou et al., 2012; Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Moustafa et al., 2014; Rizzo et al., 2007; Rose et al., 1998; Salamone et al., 2012; Vanniamparambil et al., 2012; Worden, 2000). An outlier is an observation that is numerically distant from a set of baseline data. The baseline data describes the normal operating condition of the structure under investigation (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Salamone et al., 2012). For multivariate data, a set of p-dimensional data consists of n observations in p variables. The discordancy test is expressed by the Mahalanobis squared distance, which is a non-negative scalar defined as:
 
(?8.1)where   is the measurement vector corresponding to the potential outlier, µ and ? are the mean vector and covariance matrix of the baseline, respectively. The mean and covariance matrix can be calculated with or without the potential outlier, depending upon whether inclusive or exclusive measures are preferred. The exclusive manner of baseline computation was employed in this work. For a given observation, the discordancy value, calculated using Eq. (1), is compared with a threshold value in order to classify the observation as an anomaly (i.e. outlier) or normal operating conditions of the system (inlier). A Monte Carlo simulation was employed to compute the threshold. Specifically the following procedure was used: (i) construct a p×n (dimension of feature space × number of observations) matrix in which each component is a randomly generated number from a normal distribution with zero mean and a unit variance; (ii) calculate the Mahalanobis squared distances for all the p-vector components, using Eq. (1); (iii) record the largest value in another array ?; (iv) repeat steps 1 to 3 for a large number of times (at least 1000 trials); (v) sort array ? in a descending order; (vi) the critical values for 0.1% test of discordance is the value in the sorted array ? above which 0.1% of the trials occur. In another word, the threshold is the 99.9% confidence threshold (Worden, 2000). When baseline measurements are limited, a Monte Carlo simulation is an effective method for generating a large number of random data to populate the baseline distribution (Farhidzadeh et al., 2013d; Worden, 2000).

Experimental study
Experimental tests were carried out on the earthquake simulation system of the Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation Laboratory (SEESL) at the University at Buffalo (UB). The two 50-ton 7 m x 7 m re-locatable shake tables were utilized to conduct static and dynamic testing on three full scale ductile-iron (DI) pipeline  specimens (SP1, SP2, SP3) retrofitted with InsituMain liner. Each pipeline specimen had two push-on joints located approximately at its 1/3 span.  An overview of the experimental setup is shown in Figure ?8 3. The central portion of the 9 m (30 ft) long pipeline was supported by a central concrete pedestal. It was located beneath the pipeline to hold its weight and minimize bending-induced loading. The pipeline specimen was installed on the shake tables in a direction that the bell end of the joint was facing west as shown in Figure ?8 3.  Both ends of the pipeline specimen were restrained to the west and east shake table respectively with steel restraints. The ends of the pipelines were sealed and closed with two mechanical end caps, and subsequently the pipelines were pressurized with water pressure of approximately 33 kPa (48 psi) before the tests. The water pressure was monitored at the beginning and the end of each test to ensure stable pressure in each test. The outside diameters of the pipelines were 175 mm (6.90 in). The ductile iron, mortar, and the InsituMain liner had the nominal wall thickness of 7.6 mm (0.30 in), 3.8 mm (0.15 in), and 6.35 mm (0.25 in), respectively. The curing process of the InsituMain liner formed a bond between its outer surface and the inner surface of the mortar. This liner reduces the inner diameter of the original pipelines to approximately 140 mm (5.50 in). The mechanical properties of the DI pipelines and liner used in the tests are listed in Table ?8 1 and Table ?8 2, respectively. The two shake tables were excited only in the longitudinal (axial) direction of the pipeline specimen to simulate the major transient ground deformations caused by the seismic wave propagation during an earthquake event. No soil was required during the tests because the input test motions were derived from numerical modeling that accounted for soil-pipeline interaction (Bouziou et al., 2012). A comprehensive instrumentation was deployed to capture the force-deformation and movements of the test specimens including displacement and velocity transducers, accelerometers, load cells and video cameras.

The AE system included an eight-channel high-speed data acquisition board (Physical Acoustics Corporation Micro-II PAC) and AEwin software for signal processing and storage. The outer surface of each pipeline specimen was instrumented with a linear array of eight resonant piezoelectric transducers (R15??. Preamplifiers were set at 40 dB gain and analog bandpass filters were adjusted in the interval of 20 kHz to 400 kHz. The threshold was set 45dB for each sensor. Five different test series were carried out on the shake tables; these tests are listed in Table ?8 3. Load protocols, AE sensors layout, and structural performance for each specimen are described in the following sections.

 Experimental setup and load protocol for SP1
The experimental setup used to test the first specimen (SP1) is illustrated in Figure ?8 4. The steel restraints on the concrete pedestal imposed a circumferential pressure on the specimen. The west side of the pipeline was instrumented with eight AE sensors (S1, S2,…,S8). First, monotonic testing was performed on the east joint of the specimen SP1. Then, cyclic tensile tests were performed on the west joint. Figure ?8 5 shows the loading protocols.

Figure ?8 6 depicts the force versus joint opening for SP1. By comparing Figure ?8 5 and Figure ?8 6 a smaller joint opening than the shaking table displacement can be observed. The slippage of the mounting plate bolted down on the shake table was found as the primary reason of this difference (Zhong et al., 2012). Figure ?8 6a shows the force-joint opening relationship of the east joint measured during the monotonic tensile test. This figure indicates a very ductile behavior in the longitudinal direction of the pipeline. Because the liner is a brittle composite material, the ductility indicates that delamination between the liner and pipeline occurred during the test (Zhong et al., 2012). The force-joint opening relationship of the west joint measured during the cyclic tests is shown in Figure ?8 6b. The liner failed suddenly during the 2nd cycle at a force of approximately 138kN and a joint opening of just over 4 mm (Zhong et al., 2012).

 Experimental setup and load protocol for SP2
The second specimen (SP2) was initially subjected to cyclic tensile tests on its east joint; seven cycles with a constant loading rate were carried out. Subsequently, a series of dynamic (seismic) tests were performed on the west joint of SP2. To define the input motions used in the seismic tests, a numerical model accounting for the soil-pipeline interaction during transient ground motions was developed. This model was excited by the Rinaldi motions and the resulting joint opening time-history was used for the seismic tests on the pipeline specimen (Bouziou et al., 2012). The Rinaldi ground motion record from the 1994 Northridge earthquakes is a typical near-fault ground motion with strong impulsive displacement. During the dynamic tests, three different amplitudes (50%, 100% and 125% of full scale) were used as the input motions. Figure ?8 7 shows the test setup and AE sensors layout. Load protocols are shown in Figure ?8 8. The negative part of the relative joint opening time histories in the input motions was removed, which protected the shake table equipment from sudden, rapid spikes of high compressive force.  The force-joint opening hysteretic response of the east joint during cyclic tests is shown in Figure ?8 9a. A degradation of the joint stiffness can be observed after the third cycle. The stiffness degradation was mainly caused by the delamination between the liner and the pipeline, which increases the unbonded length of the liner in the pipeline.

Due to the inelastic tensile elongation of the liner, approximately 4.0 kips of compression forces at the end of each cycle was recorded. The water pressure remained almost constant before and after each loading cycle. No liner failure or water leakage was detected during the tests. The force-joint opening hysteretic responses under the earthquake loading are shown in Figure ?8 9b for the west joint. The liner failed at 125% Rinaldi.

 Experimental setup and load protocol for SP3
The double joint dynamic tests using the Rinaldi ground motions were performed on specimen SP3. The experimental setup and sensor layout are shown in Figure ?8 10. The joint opening resulting from the numerical simulation under the Rinaldi ground motions scaled to six different amplitudes of 50%, 100%, 140%, 160%, 190% and 200% of the original-scale record were used as the input motions for this seismic test series. As described in Section 4.2, the negative portion of the relative joint opening (compression forces) was removed from the input motions to limit metal-to-metal contact forces. 
 
Figure ?8 10 Double joint test setup and AE sensor layout for SP3

The force-joint opening hysteretic responses of the two joints are shown in Figure ?8 11. A flat force plateau was observed in the tests with 140% Rinaldi and 190% Rinaldi ground motions, which can be an indication of large delamination between the liner and the pipeline in both joints for joint openings of 1.8 mm and 4.3 mm, respectively. Furthermore, significant stiffness degradation can be observed in both joints for tests with amplitudes larger than 140% of the Rinaldi ground motions. This stiffness degradation can also be due to significant debonding that occurred during these tests (Zhong et al., 2012). The west joint of SP3 failed during the 200% Rinaldi ground motion, at a force of about 143 kN and joint opening of 6.6 mm width; this was followed by significant drop in the force carried by the pipeline and a sudden increase in the joint opening, (see Figure ?8 11a). Cracks were likely nucleated in the tests with 190% Rinaldi because in the tests with 200% Rinaldi, the load suddenly dropped at almost the same joint opening as 190%, see Figure ?8 11a. However under the same input motion, the east joint remained unbroken with a peak force of 143 kN and a joint opening of 6.35 mm (Zhong et al., 2012).

Experimental results
 AE source localization
A linear source localization algorithm was used to monitor the progression of the delamination between pipeline and liner during testing. This algorithm requires the knowledge of the wave velocity ( ). Standard pencil lead break tests were carried out on the surface of the pipeline to estimate the wave velocity (Grosse and Ohtsu, 2008). The estimated wave velocity (v) was 3672 m/s. In order to estimate the progression of the delamination along the pipeline, a bivariate (i.e., 2D) histogram was built for the estimated AE locations versus time and a linear interpolation between adjacent bins was performed (Farhidzadeh et al., 2014a). Figure ?8 12 shows the results for the first specimen (SP1) during monotonic and cyclic tests. The color bar indicates the number of AE events. During monotonic testing while loading applied on the east joint, significant AE events were recorded on the right-hand side of the west joint (Figure ?8 12a). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that significant progressive delamination occurred in this section of the specimen.
   Figure ?8 12 2D Histogram of localized AE events for SP1 during (a) Monotonic (b) 1st cycle (c) 2nd cycle

Then, cyclic loading was applied on the west joint and the results are shown in Figure ?8 12b and Figure ?8 12c for cycle 1 and 2, respectively. It can be observed that significant delamination occurred in the joint area during both cycles. The left-hand side of the joint (spigot side, see Figure ?8 1) was partially delaminated at the end of cycle 1. Furthermore, it should be noted that, the number of AE events localized on the right-hand side of the joint was smaller than the left-hand side. This can be explained by the fact that, the peak displacement during cyclic loading was much lower than the peak value during the monotonic test (see Figure ?8 6). Therefore, the delamination between pipeline and liner has already occurred in this region at the end of the monotonic test. An example of delaminated section is shown in Figure ?8 13.

The estimated progression of the delamination in SP2 during the seven cycles of loading is illustrated in Figure ?8 14 using a 2D histogram of AE events versus cycle. This figure shows that delamination initiated in the joint (the weakest zone) and progressed toward both sides until cycle 4. The maximum number of AE events was recorded in this cycle, around the joint area. Interestingly, this was the cycle in which the specimen reached its maximum strength capacity (see Figure ?8 9a). Then a significant number of AE events were recorded on the left-hand side of the joint up to cycle 7. As it said earlier, it is reasonable to assume that the subsequent stiffness degradation of the specimen was attributed to the delamination between the liner and pipeline (see section 4.2). The west side of the pipeline was then tested under the Rinaldi input motion with increasing amplitude (see Figure ?8 8b). The histogram of AE events is shown in Figure ?8 15. The majority of AE events were localized in the joint area, i.e., delamination grew only about 25cm toward the spigot side.

Figure ?8 15 Distribution of localized AE events in SP2, earthquake loading on west joint
The results of the AE events distribution under dual joint earthquake test is illustrated in Figure ?8 16. In the west joint, unlike other specimens, delamination widely developed toward the bell side (see the left joint in Figure ?8 16 between 1 and 2 meter). On the other joint, akin to other experiments, delamination developed mainly in the spigot side.

Feature Selection
A preliminary study was carried out on the AE features during the loading and unloading cycles. The objective of this study was to identify a set of features capable to discriminate different loading phases, such as loading and unloading. For this purpose, AE signals recorded during each cycle were grouped into three clusters. The first cluster included AE signals recorded from zero displacement to the peak displacement of the previous cycle. The second cluster included signals recorded during the additional displacement toward the new peak displacement. The third cluster contained AE signals recorded during the unloading phase. For each signal, fourteen features were extracted, including: rise time, counts to peak, counts, energy, duration, amplitude, ASL (average signal level), average frequency, RMS (Root Mean Square), reverberation frequency, signal strength, absolute energy, frequency centroid and peak frequency (Cooperation, 2005). In order to assess the discriminatory potential of a feature, its class-conditional probability density function (PDF), was estimated.  The class-conditional probability density function p(x|?k), is the density of the feature x given that it belongs to the class (or cluster) ?k (Bishop, 2006; Duda et al., 2001). A Feature with small overlapping class conditional PDFs was considered as good discriminant feature, whereas a feature with strong overlapping was considered as bad discriminant feature, as shown in Figure ?8 17. For estimating the class-conditional PDFs, the histogram of all features were built for each cluster, and eventually three features were identified as good discriminant features, that is, duration, signal strength, and RMS.

For example, Figure ?8 18 shows the histograms obtained during cycles 2, 4 and 6 in SP2-cyclic test, for some features, including: duration, signal strength, RMS and amplitude. It can be observed that a discriminant value (or decision boundary) is identifiable for the duration, signal strength, and RMS; however, no value could be identified for the amplitude due to the strong overlapping between the clusters.  Therefore, the amplitude was considered as a bad discriminant feature. The features selected from this preliminary study were used as input to the proposed outlier analysis algorithm for automatically identifying the critical damage state.

Outlier analysis results
A statistical pattern recognition algorithm based on outlier analysis (Worden, 2000) was used to identify the joint stiffness degradation and incipient failure of the liner. Particularly, a three dimensional damage index that included the three features previously selected (i.e., duration, signal strength, and RMS) was considered. Therefore, in Eq. (1), µ was a 1×3 vector and ? was a 3×3 matrix. For the first specimen (SP1) the baseline set incorporates AE measurements acquired during the monotonic test. The results obtained for the two loading cycles are shown in Figure ?8 19. The corresponding joint opening is superimposed. The horizontal dashed line is the value of a threshold representing the 99.9% confidence calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation.

 (b)
Figure ?8 19 Outlier analysis for failure detection in SP1: (a) 1st cycle, (b) 2nd cycle

It is markedly clear that all observations associated with the incipient failure of the liner were successfully classified as outliers (Figure ?8 19b). It is interesting to note that no significant variations in D? were observed before 4mm joint opening, i.e., the peak displacement of the previous cycle. The maximum discordancy value (i.e., 530) was associated with the observation measured by the sensor S3. Since S3 was located in proximity of the joint it is reasonable to assume that the liner failed at the joint region. A digital camera was used to confirm the failure and its location (see Figure ?8 20). Interestingly, the location of the failure was on the bell side of the joint area, only 10 mm away from the end of spigot edge. Finally, to automatically identify the incipient failure of the liner in the subsequent specimen (SP2), an empirical threshold was set equal to 500. It should be pointed out that the selection of the empirical threshold depends on the loading rate and thus the threshold value of 500 was solely used during the quasi-static loadings.
 
Figure ?8 20 Liner breakage pictures taken in SP1 (Zhong et al., 2012)

Figure ?8 21 shows the outlier analysis results for SP2 during cyclic loading. In this case, the baseline set incorporates AE measurements recorded at the first cycle (C1). The corresponding joint opening is superimposed. All observations associated with the joint stiffness degradation starting from the third cycle (see Figure ?8 9a) were successfully classified as outliers shown in Figure ?8 21c-g. Particularly, the outlier analysis was able to identify the initial onset of nonlinearity which occurred at C3. Since the discordancy value did not reach the empirical threshold defined in SP1 (i.e., D=500) in any cycle, no failure of the liner was expected. The water pressure remained almost constant before and after each loading cycle. In addition, a visual inspection was carried out to verify the integrity of liner using a digital camera guided into the pipeline. As expected, no failure was detected.
Figure ?8 22 shows the results for SP2 during dynamic (seismic) tests. In this case, the baseline set incorporates AE measurements recorded with 50% Rinaldi ground motion. The corresponding joint opening is superimposed.

Clearly, the first set of outliers was observed at 100% Rinaldi, and this could be an indication that significant stiffness degradation occurred during this loading step. Hysteresis loops in Figure ?8 9b provided additional evidence of this conclusion. At 125% a loud sound was heard and the water pressure in the pipeline significantly dropped, which indicated the failure of the liner. Given that the outlier set is mainly consist of the data from sensors {7, 6, 3, 2} and the majority of events were localized close to the joint (see Figure ?8 15), it is expected that the liner is broken at the joint area. Figure ?8 23 shows a picture of the liner right at the joint after the dynamic testing. Since the maximum discordancy value (i.e., 220) was recorded at 125% Rinaldi, the empirical threshold of 200 was assumed for dynamic loading rate to predict the failure in the subsequent specimen SP3.

Figure ?8 24 shows the outlier analysis results for specimen SP3. Also in this case, the baseline set incorporates AE measurements recorded with 50% Rinaldi input motion. The corresponding joint opening is superimposed. At 100% Rinaldi a small number of observations were classified as outliers. Particularly, the highest discordancy value was recorded by sensor S6, which was located on the east joint. Figure ?8 11b shows that slight stiffness degradation occurred at this loading stage, whereas negligible stiffness degradation occurred at the west joint. Then, a significant number of outliers were observed in the subsequent loading steps in which the joints stiffness decreased significantly. Furthermore, the level of discordancy increased with the severity of the damage until the failure of the liner at 200% Rinaldi. The discordancy value at failure was about 200, which matches that of the same value obtained for the failure of SP2. Since the maximum discordancy values were recorded by S2 and S3, a failure located at the west joint was expected. The visual inspection confirmed the estimated location of breakage (see Figure ?8 25).

Conclusions
This chapter presented the results of an experimental study that aimed at monitoring the performance of underground pipeline-lining systems, subjected to static and dynamic (i.e., seismic) loading, using acoustic emission technique. Experimental tests were carried out on the earthquake simulation system of the Structural Engineering and Earthquake Simulation Laboratory (SEESL) at the University at Buffalo (UB). Two re-locatable shake tables were utilized to conduct static and dynamic testing on three full scale ductile-iron (DI) pipelines (SP1, SP2, SP3) retrofitted with InsituMain liner. Two damage mechanisms were investigated: 1) delamination between pipeline and liner, and 2) onset of plastic response and incipient failure of the liner. Quasi-static tests were carried out to investigate the effect of loading and unloading phases on AE features. Dynamic tests were conducted to study the behavior of the pipeline-liner system at higher loading rates. The Rinaldi record from the 1994 Northridge earthquakes was used [46]. During the dynamic tests, different amplitudes were used as input motions. Finally, a statistical pattern recognition technique based on a multivariate outlier analysis was successfully deployed to identify the onset of critical damage, that is, joint stiffness degradation and incipient failure for the liner. The evaluation of results demonstrated that the joints are the most susceptible section of the pipe; initiation of delamination and plastic behavior as well as failure occurs at the joint region. It is envisioned that such a system could inform decision makers about the need for repair to ensure the safe and reliable operation of underground infrastructure. However, more formal tests need to be conducted to verify the robustness of the approach. For example, the effects of sensors selection, and changing environmental conditions should be examined.


 

SUMMARY, CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Summary 
Civil structures are critical components of a sustainable society. The safety and durability of structures plays a key role in ensuring economic and industrial prosperity. Therefore, it is important to reliably assess the operational condition of structures. The primary objective of this dissertation is to design integrated Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems for the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) of civil structures. Armed with advanced data processing tools such as pattern recognition, uncertainty analysis, fractals and chaos, and theory of wave propagation in solids, automated monitoring systems were designed for reinforced/prestressed concrete structures and pipelines. These systems were validated through full-scale experimental studies. 
It is proposed to use NDE techniques, such as acoustic emission (AE), guided ultrasonic waves (GUW), and automated visual inspection, coupled to advanced statistical-based signal processing algorithms to locate and diagnose structural anomalies. Damage in reinforced concrete shear walls, prestressing steel strands, and pipelines are the main structural components for which SHM and NDE systems were designed.
Reinforced concrete (RC) shear walls are critical structural components in gravity and lateral force resisting systems. In the last two decades, several efforts have been made to monitor cracking in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. The first objective of this dissertation was to design an automated monitoring system capable of assessing damage in RC shear walls. The proposed system is based on a sparse array of piezoelectric transducers to receive acoustic emissions and statistical pattern recognition algorithms to interpret the underlying source of damage. The proposed methods were validated on two full scale RC shear walls subjected to quasi-static cyclic loading. The systems demonstrated the competency of AE in identifying critical state of damage and alerting the necessity of repair before imminent failure. The current expense of this system, which is mainly its ultra-fast data acquisition system, might be considered as a shortcoming of this NDE technique. With the advancement of technology, the cost of AE systems may reduce, leading to a more economically efficient workaround for monitoring critical structures.
Currently assessing the performance and safety of almost all reinforced concrete structures relies on routine-based visual inspection (VI). Cracks width measurements are commonly used as a convenient indicator of damage; however other factors, such as distribution and pattern of the cracks should be considered equally important in measuring the extent of damage present in a structure. Condition assessed by VI is subjective in nature and depends on the experience, knowledge, expertise, and judgment of the inspector carrying out the assessment. A new approach based on the fractal analysis of patterns of residual cracks is proposed in this dissertation to assess the structural integrity of reinforced concrete elements. A new damage index is presented to perform a damage classification quantitatively. The methodology is validated through experimental studies on two large-scale reinforced concrete shear walls subjected to a displacement controlled reversed cyclic loading. Damage grades are also identified based on width of residual cracks and the proposed damage index (DI). The results demonstrate a more accurate estimation of damage grades using the DI because the width of partially closed cracks eventuates in erroneous decision on damage grade classification. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the DI can estimate the relative stiffness loss of the specimens with acceptable accuracy, especially during linear mechanical behavior. The DI indirectly takes into account an average cross-section loss, which is proportional to stiffness loss.
Another key contribution of this dissertation is developing a novel NDE technique based on Guided Ultrasonic Waves (GUW) to diagnose initiation and progress of corrosion in prestressing 7-wire steel strands. A new experimental setup is designed to accelerate corrosion in a loaded strand, monitor load during corrosion, and estimate the change in diameter of wires using ultrasonic waves. The results show that the velocity of GUW at a tuned frequency range has an outstanding potential for in-situ assessment of the corrosion condition where reference base-line is not available. In addition, it can be used to estimate the pre-stress loss considering the energy of waveforms.
Designing a reliable SHM system for pipelines is another objective of this research. In-situ pipeline lining technology has received significant interest over the past three decades to increase the operational lifetime of existing underground pipelines without laborious and costly excavation, replacement, and embankment. This research presents the results of an experimental study to evaluate the acoustic emission potential in monitoring full scale pipeline-lining systems under static and dynamic (seismic) loading. Particularly, two damage mechanisms are investigated: (1) delamination between pipeline and liner, (2) incipient failure of the liner. A statistical pattern recognition technique based on a multivariate outlier analysis is presented for automatically identifying the onset of critical damage. Such a system could inform decision makers about the need for repair and ultimately ensures the safe and reliable operation of underground infrastructure. 

Conclusions
The conclusions of each study are given at the end of each chapter. Here, the key conclusions of this dissertation are presented:
1- Acoustic emission monitoring of reinforced concrete structures: 
	In general, the AE activity increased exponentially when the specimen was close to the failure.
	b-value analysis can be used to follow the fracture process in RC shear walls but it seems difficult to produce conclusive results.
	The overall trend of the b-value analysis is not affected by the group size used for the calculation although the value might be subjected to strong fluctuations due to normal operational condition (i.e., temperature and environmental noise). 
	b-value-based outlier analysis can be a reliable way to automatically identify critical damage conditions and reduce the likelihood of false alarm.
	A Gaussian moving average has been successfully proposed to improve the interpretation of the b-value results.
	The minimum value of filtered b-value was observed when the specimen reached its maximum strength capacity.
	The filtered b-value increases at the stage of micro-crack nucleation and follow a plateau trend when macro-cracks start to form. Then it decreases as macro-cracks open and reaches its minimum value at the maximum structural capacity. B-values drop to almost 80% of their maximum value as an indicator of macro-crack opening and critical damage.
	The cluster analysis based on the k-means was successfully applied to automatically classify the AE sources as tensile or shear cracks.
	Provided the population of shear and tensile signals, a new method called Sifted b-value analysis was proposed to determine the scale of cracks (i.e., micro or macro) for each crack mode. It was observed that the onset of decreasing trend in shear Sb-value coincides shear macro-crack opening and the inception of yielding.	 
	An unsupervised Bayesian-based pattern recognition algorithm called Gaussian Mixture Modeling was proposed to probabilistically cluster the acoustic emission data generated from different crack modes. 
	Instead of conventional classification scheme, a nonlinear decision boundary is proposed using a likelihood ratio test on the outcome of GMM. 
	Bayesian information criterion was tested to uncover the number of hidden clusters within the data set. 
	The GMM algorithm could identify three stages during the test: 1) a dominance of tensile (flexural) cracks during the initial load steps, 2) a transition stage during the intermediate load steps, and 3) a dominance of shear cracks during the final load steps.
	The majority of shear type cracks at the critical state of damage can be highlighted using the GMM algorithm.

2- Advanced visual inspection of concrete structures using fractal analysis:
	A novel approach based on the fractal dimension (FD) of crack patterns was proposed to assess the structural integrity of RC structures.
	The approach was validated through large-scale tests on two RC shear walls subjected to lateral reversed cyclic loading. It was observed that in general the fractal dimension increases as the surface damage increases.
	Further, a damage index (DI) based on fractal dimension of visible residual cracks was introduced. It was shown that the proposed DI could be exploited to estimate the remnant lateral stiffness of the wall. 
	This method could discriminate different damage grades without taking the residual crack width into account, while conventional crack width measurements failed to accurately identify critical state of damage. It was found that at damage grade I (slight damage), the proposed DI is below 0.4. Moderate damage, DGII, yields a DI between 0.4 and 0.7 and finally damage grade is critical beyond DI=0.7.
	The proposed index could have a role in post-disaster assessment and planning by estimating the vulnerability of buildings exposed to natural hazards (storms, earthquakes, etc.) and enabling authorities to decide whether or not a building can be safely re-occupied.

3- Corrosion diagnosis in multi-wire steel strands using guided ultrasonic waves:
	Loading cause leakage of ultrasonic energy from one wire to another. Anchorage dissipates the energy in low frequency (around 200-300 kHz) and the inter-wire contact attenuates mainly the higher frequency components (400-600 kHz). 
	Attenuation coefficient can increase to 35 dB as a result of corrosion. 
	A reference-free algorithm was proposed to quantify the extent of corrosion through estimating the cross section loss using dispersion curves, continuous wavelet transform, and the velocity of certain frequency components in the waveforms.
	A new test setup was designed to accelerate corrosion on a loaded steel strand and validate the method experimentally. 
	The propagation of Heisenberg uncertainty to diameter measurement is also investigated.  The method could reasonably estimate the diameter of the wires without any baseline as a reference.

4- Damage assessment of pipelines:
	Two damage mechanisms were investigated: 1) delamination between pipeline and liner, and 2) onset of plastic response and incipient failure of the liner. 
	Linear acoustic emission source localization technique is used to quantify the extent of delamination. 
	Multivariate Mahalanobis square distance is successfully deployed to identify the onset of critical damage, that is, joint stiffness degradation and incipient failure for the liner. 
	Initiation of delamination and plastic behavior as well as failure occurs at the joint region. 
	It is envisioned that such a system could inform decision makers about the need for repair to ensure the safe and reliable operation of underground infrastructure. 
	More formal tests need to be conducted to verify the robustness of the approach. For example, the effects of sensors selection, and changing environmental conditions should be examined.




Recommendations for future research
Recommendations for future research are presented as follows:
1- Acoustic emission monitoring of concrete structures:
The pattern recognition algorithms used in this dissertation to cluster acoustic emission data were all unsupervised, meaning the data were sampled from unknown sources. To design and test more reliable and robust SHM system based on acoustic emission, supervised pattern recognition algorithms should be studied. To this end, particular experiments are to be designed to label the AE data (e.g., introduce controlled cracking modes in separate experiments). AE sensors record labeled data and decision boundaries are defined according to the distance from source of cracks.
Furthermore, the algorithms proposed for assessment of reinforced concrete shear walls can be adapted to monitor steel plate-concrete composite shear walls. In composite shear walls, concrete is sandwiched between two steel plates that are connected using bolts (Epackachi et al., 2014, 2013), see Figure ?9 1. As a feasibility study, a preliminary investigation on the AE monitoring of these laterally resistant structural components was carried out. The results demonstrated the capability of AE in highlighting critical damaged (see Figure ?9 2 and Figure ?9 3). The Gaussian Mixture Modeling as well as sifted b-value analysis can be investigated in future to characterize multi-scale damage states.

2- Nondestructive evaluation of sandwich structures using Infrared thermography: 
Infrared thermography can also be considered to identify damage initiation in composite shear walls (i.e., debonding between concrete and steel plates). The application of IR thermography is motivated by heat transfer phenomenon. In a pristine structure, the input heat energy can leak to concrete through its bond with steel plate (see Figure ?9 4) and thus the temperature does not increase significantly on the steel surface. On the other hand, when steel plate loses its bond with concrete (e.g., due to local buckling), the energy is preserved in steel plate and cause a considerable temperature rise. Figure ?9 5a shows a schematic setup for IR thermography in an active configuration and Figure ?9 5b exhibits a photo from the experimental setup. 
Figure ?9 6 illustrates a damaged composite shear wall monitored by IR thermography camera. The dark and light regions represent cooler and warmer areas, representing pristine and damaged zones, respectively. The boxes on Figure ?9 6 represent discrete zones to be interrogated. Figure ?9 7 displays the corresponding temperature variation during heating and cooling phase at zones B1, B2, B3, B6, and B12. The temperature for damaged zones B1, B2, and B6, increases faster than intact zones B3 and B12. This result is in reasonable agreement with visual inspections (see Figure ?9 2). This preliminary study offers a new research topic to yield a rapid NDE technique for assessment of this structural component.

3- Automated visual inspection of concrete structures:
To create an automated vision-based nondestructive evaluation, extensive study needs to be devoted on fractal and multi-fractal behavior of cracking patterns in different concrete components. Image processing techniques should be trained to retrieve the surface damage patterns automatically, measure the crack width, quantify the erratic crack patterns and yield a reliable damage grade (Farhidzadeh et al., 2014b).
4- Corrosion damage interrogation in pre-stressed concrete structures
To study corrosion process in pre-stressed concrete structures, the accelerated corrosion can be repeated on a steel strand embedded in concrete. Concrete/grout and accumulated rust can affect the characteristics of ultrasonic waves in a steel strand. For instance, concrete reduces the length at which GUW can travel as it increases the attenuation coefficient. In addition, corroded residues remain in the concrete and impose circumferential pressure which results in concrete cracking and localized (pitting) corrosion. A new numerical model is needed to account for the grout that surrounds the strand. In addition, a laser ultrasound can be used to generate ultrasonic wave from a distance to tackle the inaccessibility problem (see Figure ?9 8). Other methods such as EIT (Electrically Isolated Tendons) are worth to be investigated as well.

5- Online monitoring or rapid assessment of pipelines:
To develop the pipeline SHM system, formal experiments should be designed to characterize effect of soil on AE behavior of buried pipes. In addition, degradation of bonding between sensor and the pipe should be studied as it adversely affects the results. In an active mode, one can investigate guided ultrasonic waves (GUW) as a tool for routine inspections. The velocity of GUW can be used to estimate the cross-section loss as a result of corrosion. 


 
Appendix
This section presents the mathematics needed for uncertainty quantification discussed in Chapter 7 on corrosion. 

A.1. Velocity pdf
In general, the mean and variance of the reciprocal of a random variable can be obtained using its equivalent Taylor series at mean value as follows: denoting the expected value (mean) of a random variable t as  and defining a random variable v as a function of t as  , we have:
Taylor series:  
(A.1)
thus the expected value of v can be found as:
 
(A.2)
In our case, since the variance in time, , is very small in comparison to the measured time  , we can eliminate the second term in equation (A.2) and simply define the velocity mean as:
 
(A.3)
and the velocity variance as,
 
(A.4)
A.2. Monte Carlo simulation
The Monte Carlo simulation samples a large number of data from the underlying probability space to generate a family of test points random, feeds forward the samples individually through the exact nonlinear function to find the output data deterministically, and finally evaluates the pdf of outputs. In this study, a large number of data points (>10000) were sampled from the velocity pdf ( , ), and were fed into the inverse of dispersion function to find (fd)i  deterministically (i.e.,  ). Next, another set of n data points are randomly sampled from the frequency pdf (i.e.,  ,  ). Assuming statistical independency between frequency and diameter, the diameter di is found ( ). Therefore, the diameter pdf parameters,   and , are computed having the set of di’s. It is worth to mention that the outliers are eliminated from calculation of mean and variance (i.e., remove   if  and recalculate   and ) since the number of sampled points were limited and outliers could cause error.

A.3. Unscented transformation
The Unscented Transform is a method for estimating the statistics of a random variable which undergoes a nonlinear transformation as in  (Julier and Uhlmann, 2004). Assuming the velocity as a random variable  with the mean  and variance , only three weighted sigma points ?0, ?1, and ?2 are needed to calculate the statistics of v. These points are given by:
 
(A.5)
where Wi is the weight associated with the ith sigma point and ? is an arbitrary number providing 1+???0; ? = 0 is chosen in this work. Given the set of sigma points calculated by equation (A.5), the transformation of velocity pdf to the approximated fd pdf is summarized in the following steps:
1-Calculate the fd corresponding to each sigma point using dispersion function: 
 
(A.6)
2- The mean of fd is calculated from:
 
(A.7)
3- The variance of random variable fd is determined by:
 
(A.8)
Since f and d are statistically independent, the following equation holds for estimating  
 
(A.9)
and thus  is calculated as,
 
(A.10)
Given   and  , one can calculate  using the variance relationship for the product of independent variables (i.e.,  ) as follows:
 
(A.11)

A.4. Delta method
Delta method uses the second-order Taylor expansions to find the variance of a function of a random variable. Given a random variable x and a function g(x), the variance of this function is obtained as follows,
 
(A.12)
where   is the derivative of the function g with respect to x. In case of this study, velocity v is the variable and   is the function. Therefore, we have:
 
(A.13)
Given  , the variance of diameter   is calculated via equation (A.11) and  is given through equation (A.10).
